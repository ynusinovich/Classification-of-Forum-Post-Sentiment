Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ngoni,t2_86rj0,And in America we mark everything down to Wuhan flu so our state city hospital gets more resources. Funny how that works.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,LseaD,t2_t0dnu,Agree. Only thing I think people forget is that it s not only old people. I am 23 and had a major DVT and pulmonary embolism a year ago that almost killed me. I have permanent lung damage from the pulmonary embolism and my doctor stressed to me that I really need to limit my exposure because I could very likely die if I get this and experience respiratory issues.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Ldawsonm,t2_ulmap,Well as an agnostic I must say you bring up some good points. With this quarantine locking me in my home I should have some time to do some research on that. It was good talking to you and I hope you have a good night.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Ar509,t2_3mil1hhs,In my state Washington only 1 of deaths have been people below the age of 40 and 93 of deaths are people of 60. This virus while quite dangerous for the elderly and those with pre existing conditions is simply not killing hardly any young or middle aged healthy people.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,COVID-19Enthusiast,t2_5v9flhf4,I want a place where both sides can openly share views and have discussions and debates without it resulting in arguments insults ignoring evidence we don't like banning or criticizing someone simply for expressing a dissenting opinion or having to write a small report with every post including citations. As it is now we're so divided it seems we either push people out of a sub until one side dominates it to the point it becomes repulsive for others to go to or we run away and create our own safe place that becomes the same thing with an opposing dynamic. That seems like it might be too much to hope for right now but this polarization is tearing us apart and only having communities that support or attack our pre existing ideas is only going to make that worse.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Sexyman469,t2_q1gbl,That is a ridiculous analogy. You put the mask on yourself first because if you pass out the child is incapable of putting the mask on themselves or the adult. Other countries are not your children. This is a global issue with allies trying to work together. Canada sheltered Americans on 9 11. Never asked for anything in return. Gave them shelter food necessities. Would Americans do that for Canadians We can't give them shelter cause America has to put America first. Should Canada withhold its pulp Singapore withhold the 3M masks made in its factories How many outsourced 3M factories are there Should those governments seize the 3M factories in their countries That seems to be the type of free market this sub is starting to support. But yes thanks for being such a great neighbour. Don't forget to chant all lives matter while endangering your neighbours up north.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,the-jds,t2_w7kfif5,It really sounds like you just need to use some Lysol.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ngoni,t2_86rj0,So the actual stockpile and the disposition policy hasn't changed just the PR notice on a website. I think it's a good idea to remind states that the feds simply can't bail them all out of their shortfalls. Hurricanes floods etc are generally isolated so the feds can really focus resources with little regard to other needs. That creates a false expectation that the feds can do so even in a situation like a pandemic. I really worry what happens when everyone looks to the feds to somehow provide life support to a 22T yr economy and all the unemployment funds are gone. But I guess the printing press just goes brrrrrr' and no one cares. But I know I know orange man bad so he isn't allowed to say no to anyone ever. I get it.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,maltodextrin2,t2_10obyx,Brilliant
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,skarface6,t2_3upit,Are you into empiricism and or scientism The evidence for God is varied and people accept some things and not others. If you d like logic alone then check out the many proofs for God s existence. If you re interesting in the world going wonky for no other reason then see miracles. If you re fine with people s experiences then check out their many testimonies similar to witness testimony in court Et al. I have to sleep but that should answer your question. I asked about empiricism and scientism because they preclude the supernatural. You re not going to find evidence of spiritual things if you start off with there are no spiritual things
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Dope_Reddit_Guy,t2_1zpzfxg7,I knew a guy in law school who threw away his roommates absentee ballot because he knew he was going to vote for Trump. That kid is now In law school. Mail in voting is a bad idea This stuff will absolutely happen.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,_DryvBy_,t2_d62qu,If any church is open during this I'd quit going and bash them honestly. The Bible has rules about sickly being in congregations and quarantines. We don't know who's sick and it's not instant so follow these biblical teachings. But I guess you gotta read last the tithing and John 3 16 verse long enough to realize that. I'm 100 religious too but if you claim to live the Bible follow it.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Ar509,t2_3mil1hhs,The CDC always has about 2 000 less deaths than this site does. Don t know who is correct just noting the fact.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,CZPCR9,t2_4mdxvsyz,What civilian has an N95 these days Even simple dust masks used for home construction projects are sold out in stores... Wolf is encouraging home made masks. Constantly touching your face as you're shopping to mess with a mask you don't have set up right is arguably worse than no mask at all. And having a crap mask setup could be unhelpful as well as the user may think it's helping when it isn't I saw everything from tshirts up over the nose to scarfs to dust masks with the nose bridge informed to pretty well made looking cloth ones with elastic. Most people had masks on the crappiest end of the spectrum and were almost permanently adjusting them. Promote good practices all you want that's great but if the government mandates mask wearing that's when the line is crossed. And from what I saw on my latest grocery run people apparently need coaching on how to wear these things too so efforts are probably best spent informing than mandating anyway.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,PlanZSmiles,t2_ig7gy,And that's where you are misunderstanding the time frame of the water weight loss. He lost 11 in 3 days meaning he could have lost 4 the first 4 the second and 3 the third. For a high dehydration point of 11 His body could have stopped dropping water weight at that point and began restoration of it's average water weight level depending on how is recovery from Covid 19 was.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,HonorRoll,t2_jm16b,Lol no ones happy except the people saying that 100k dead is a good job after stating the whole thing was a dem hoax. I voted for trump in the last election because he saves me 15k a year in taxes 60k during his term but im willing to give that up for a more competent leader that will actually have people in outposts around the world in countries that are far from honest. saving our citizens from unnecessary threats such as this pandemic. im willing to look at the whole picture whereas alot of people in politics only care about their team
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,evergreenpanda,t2_5x55mvpb,Come on be smarter than that there are serious ramifications for a company complying with that order. We are talking about a free market economy and you re advocating for them to cripple their international business sales They source material from Canada and have factories all over the world what s the long term here not just the short term.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Neutral_admin,t2_3hrvqfor,Look we aren't without our assholes but for the most part as long as you aren't coming here just to cause shit and calling people retarded we might disagree with you even very passionately and things might get heated but end of the day we will on the large welcome you here. Your ideas won't be popular but we are more than willing to hear them and discuss them. We do tend to punch back and when taken out of context we can be made to look like jerks but we are just passionate people like anyone else. Welcome here and here's to many arguments between us in the future. But think of it like we are professional wrestlers we will talk mean in the ring and after that the beers don't care who we voted for.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,skarface6,t2_3upit,gt I only say he s a hypocrite because the religion he represents is based on a relative truth. Except you re wrong. Catholicism is all about objective truth. It s not an empirical truth but only empiricists say that everything must be proven empirically except there fundamental rule because reasons It absolutely is a fact that God is real. Facts don t belong only to the empirical realm. Hence his statement that I quoted. There s a lot more to the world.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,diegatorsNtigersfans,t2_53p10c5a,I disagree with Trump on this. I d like to see online voting and voting by mail become the norm. It s 2020. It seems faintly ridiculous that in the richest country in the world you have to go to an elementary school and stand in line for two hours to vote. The notion that it can t be done seems like a defeatist attitude.

He has had people like Yang on the program and I personally really enjoy listening to people I might disagree with sit down and have a good faith discussion. I wish more of us could just talk about our disagreements politely. I m no saint and I ve said mean things about people on the left online I m sure if you look at my history you would find something I ve said that I would never say to someone s face No one is perfect but I really try to be civil online. I m always polite and calm when discussing politics with someone in person but I m trying to be more civil online. I agree with a lot of the things Shapiro says because I think our philosophical beliefs align a lot however I disagree with him sometimes. I think skepticism is a good thing especially when you are reading or listening to someone you already agree with

Also China needs to be run out of our colleges and businesses They pay off and control a lot government officials
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ngoni,t2_86rj0,I don't think anyone is advocating for guilty until proven innocent.' What most are making light of is the rank hypocrisy. Their rules don't apply to them only to Republicans. It took 30 years for even some of them to admit Bill Clinton is a scumbag. Maybe it'll only take 15 for Biden.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,RusrusFrisbee,t2_16c1jz,What I have noticed is that the US number of deaths has been doubling every three days consistently for at least a couple weeks now. Hit 1000 on mar 26 2000 on mar 29 4000 on Apr 1. That seems to be what most countries do until they hit hospital capacities. Then it doubles almost every 2 days. If we keep doubling on the threes we will be at 100 000 before the end of April. If that s the peak it will be another 100 000 more as the virus peters out. We have had more time to plan than other countries so hopefully we don t run into capacity problems.

Yes you can shout to your hearts content and you will only hear your own ideas and your own problems this way. As an added bonus when this is all over and you retreat from your DIY burrow it will be just as obvious in person as it is online to tell that you are in fact a shit head.

And finally poll taxes are definitively unconstitutional as are educational requirements. Nothing in the Constitution specifically protects gun license fees.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,JuicedBoxers,t2_4wndeovt,Well please understand that your political acceptance acknowledgment is of a rare breed.. while I can appreciate you for being courteous and understanding toward beliefs that challenge your own especially in today s society of stark hatred toward opposition it s difficult to really view liberal ideology anymore without really feeling bogged down by absolute hate disgust aggression.. And I mean none of that toward you and of course it exists on both sides of the line. But it s nearly impossible to voice anything semi moderate in any other political board without getting hate mail and downvoted into oblivion. Your last line is 100 true but that also is found few and far between these days. Unfortunately politics is too hotly contested for there to be actual fruitful debate without all the quick hateful attacks that destroy the comment and instead we all reside back into our echo chambers in order to maintain some sanity.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ultimis,t2_5xpfs,2. 5 3 million people die every year in the United States. Comparing it to 9 11 without actually understanding why 9 11 was bad is extremely ignorant. It's like when Bernie went around claiming 9 11 X 10 people would die from repealing Obamacare. It shows a profound stupidity.

I also keep seeing what you re saying repeated over and over most people don t know how to wear them So.. the focus should be on education and fitting them correctly to your face. What I m saying is it shouldn t take government mandating people wearing masks because common sense should be enough for everyone to wear one. In this case people think it s just a suggestion and are spreading virus all over the place while people are dying from this.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,LseaD,t2_t0dnu,Totally agree. Fox News is biased to the right. CNN is biased to the left. I don t see what s wrong with identifying the politics of the news station or website you are getting your information from. I honestly prefer it. The daily wire is openly conservative and admit to having a conservative slant to their story selection. What s wrong with that At least you know where the writers and editors stand and don t try to lie and say they are unbiased. I personally like reading news from fox daily wire cnn wsj washington post etc. I figure if there is a bit of data that is consistent across all sites then that bit of data is more likely to be an actual fact. I can make my own opinions. I don t need CNN or Fox to tell me how to think about a piece of information.

Personally I don t believe there s a god and that s just my opinion and I can t say it s a fact. Catholicism is rooted in the idea that god is real powerful and you should have faith in his existence. The issue is that Catholicism asserts that it is truth that god is real. Since there isn t much evidence to support this you shouldn t assert it as fact. I m sure this guy is very intelligent and contributed a lot of great work to our world I m just saying that this one aspect of him makes him a hypocrite.

Everyone will make the occasional misstatements or support what people believe are unworkable policy. But the volume of just plain old dumb shit AOC spouts forces people to question her thought process and who is advising her. She is young vibrant a fairly good public speaker and evidently attractive to some of the public. But holy cow some of the stuff she says.

One side is liberal and will always push an agenda more liberal than today's The other is conservative and seeks too restrict the influence of the other. This is two party politics in a nutshell. You must choose if you want to enable unrestricted power of government and lesser power of yourself or if you want to support individualism and it's political influence. I personal believe that all governments end up as socialist or communist because the citizens take their freedoms for granted and vote for self indulgent policies until the liberal party take authority and only the elite political players live the life that the citizens should live.

Each resident is mailed a ballot and an envelope to return it in that has been prepaid postage. You are mailed a ballot pamphlet which has the candidates their profiles and official statements and a list of the issues. There is a pro argument for the issue and a against argument for the issue. Each argument is provided by the group pushing for the initiative or defending against the initiative. The voter is given 2 3 weeks to mail in their ballot or to drop it off at a designated voting station. It's actually pretty easy and there hasn't been much if any controversy over fraud despite some close elections. amp x200B Other states are free to design their own process.

How do you know the total is correct if you can only check your individual ballot Blockchain might get us partly there but then you lose your anonymity. With physical ballots we can institute chain of custody and two person integrity among other processes to limit the opportunities for fraud. The big problem is with mail and electronic now you can create a person that never existed and it's damn near impossible to prove. In person with ID is the only way to know a real human voted.

She didn't even think about it when she put her red cap on.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,revanholdt,t2_o9gi3,gt Though initially passed in response to the Korean War the DPA is historically based on the War Powers Acts of World War II. Gradually Congress has expanded the term national defense as defined in the DPA. Based on this definition the scope of DPA authorities now extends beyond shaping U.S military preparedness and capabilities as the authorities may also be used to enhance and support domestic preparedness response and recovery from natural hazards terrorist attacks and other national emergencies. So yeah you don't need to be engaged in conventional war with another country to invoke it. All that remains is agreement on wether you think the coronavirus epidemic constitutes a national emergency requiring extraordinary measure to safeguard the lives of Americans. If you don't think so then we have a difference of opinion which is perfectly fine

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,IBiteYou,t2_8is6t,gt If it happens all the time does that speak for the left Kind of yes. Because this is our subreddit. But also... the vitriol you see on the leftist subreddits speaks for the left too. gt But I don t agree with taking the extreme example of a group and then saying that they re all like that. It s not logical it s bandwagoning. It's my experience as a moderator on reddit. gt What if and this wouldn t be hard I found examples of people talking about how liberals should die or something like this Those subreddits would be quickly banned by the admins. gt And said you thought that I'm not saying that YOU want us to die.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Al123397,t2_1qy4r8uh,The problem that my companies and many others face is that foreign labor for high paying jobs is simply better than the domestic one with same qualifications for example the workers from India get a bachelors in India and come here to do master's and get a job here. But these same people are more motivated and harder working than their American counter parts. They also get paid the same as American counter part so it's not even cheaper labor. In fact it actually costs more for companies to hire foreigners as they have to pay the cost to sponsor them. It's simple the American education model needs to drastically change and output higher level graduates

According to Wikipedia 33 of the world's population is Christian 48 of the US is Protestant while Catholics make up 23 So 71 of the US is Christian. That leaves about 30 non Christians. That's still a division. A rather significant division of people who don't celebrate Easter. Why are you dividing our great nation instead of focusing on what unites us

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,PlanZSmiles,t2_ig7gy,Literally not what I said lol. Your water weight adjust based on your bodies needs and how it is replenished. He probably holds closer to the average amount of water weight which is 65 of their body. He possibly lost 7. 5 of water mass in the span of 3 days due to lack of replenishing fluids lack of appetite and off on sweating. His body will adjust after he is healthy and may assume back to his 65 of water weight. When he starts working out again then his body may end up storing more water weight possibly up to 75 Then when his body has adjusted back to normal it will get back to 65 His daily fluctuations may range from 60 70 water weight due to what he's eating and how much water he takes in. Stop being ignorant. I'm not making anything up I was athlete for 14 years of my life and spent another 7 years in health and fitness as a hobby.

What I m saying is that I don t think that s representative of the left. I m glad you don t go to those subreddits and say that kind of thing. But this is indeed the response I have. I certainly don t agree with what the person said I don t even share their political views in general. But I don t agree with taking the extreme example of a group and then saying that they re all like that. It s not logical it s bandwagoning. What if and this wouldn t be hard I found examples of people talking about how liberals should die or something like this And said you thought that Because here s a conservative saying it. What if someone says it here On this post Do you feel comfortable being represented by the worst examples in your party There s an easy joke to make here even the worst blah blah blah. But you d be surprised how similar the worst examples can look.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,803kidcoop,t2_1fu8ad2q,I don t understand what you re getting at with these numbers.. You re saying a small amount of people owned slaves That s because it was considered immoral and one major conflict away from being illegal... and yet a large portion of the country seceded to fight for that right You re also arguing 5 of people but conveniently ignoring 24. 9 of households... It s interesting that you tried to find a way to distract from the point I was making. Since you can t figure out where I was going with it I ll just lay it out for you. The founding fathers based their ideas on Christian views because that s all they knew just as they continued slavery because that s all they knew until people in the country began to realize it was unconstitutional and needed to be changed Likewise people in this country have begun to realize hey it s not right that Christians get to decide what my rights are based on their religions when maybe I m a Buddhist atheist etc. No this isn t the government saying be a Christian or be killed at least not blatantly so. But how many wars have been waged with justifications based in Christian values Because we were the good guys. How many laws are written with Christian beliefs as their backbones impeding on the rights of countless Americans Nowhere in the constitution does it say that religion in government is simply to keep the big bad feds from killing you for carrying a bible. To argue that this is the implication of certain pieces is taking words at face value... at best. If it were up to many Americans in this country they d never have the president standing behind a Christian leader telling them to read their bibles because it s the constant obvious symbol that although nobody is gonna come right out and say we re a Christian country and you ll follow Christian rules regardless it s pretty darned obvious what s going on. Religion after all is literally the ONLY reason there is a debate about burning topics like marriage equality and abortion after all. Keep telling yourself there isn t an established religion in this country just because you can t or won t read between the lines.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,HippyDippyCommieGuy,t2_pzplee,To be fair reports say they re mostly testing people who are severe enough to be hospitalized. The actual prevalence may be significantly higher.

I don't care what you call your god or if you don't have one at all. I think if you're from a foreign country and you want to come live among us legally you're to be respected. I think as a society we should embrace people who are trying to better themselves offer the guidance they need to succeed. And I also think if politicians ask me to sacrifice my hard earned dollar they should respect my labor and not squander that dollar. And that's about it.

When leading a nation you have to decide between destroying people economically over what might be a false alarm or believing the numbers the WHO was telling us. East Asain nations knew the WHO was full of shit because they could see China's fingers up their asses telling them what to say. Western Nations unfortunately believed the UN the WHO and China because why would they lie China lied because China's the proverbial scorpion on the frog back crossing the river and it turns out the west is the overly trusting frog.

Water weight is held and lost as the body uses it and your body uses fluids far more when you are sick. People can wake up one day and weigh 7 lbs over their weight. It s why a lot of people quit working out after their New Years resolutions they start working out and suddenly gain weight in the first few days or weeks. Our bodies can adjust water weight quickly based on what we need.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,anihilistlol,t2_5wz6u,I'm not against more affordable healthcare nor is any conservative. I personally support safety nets. Where we differ is how we are supposed to pay for it. I don't support giving the government more money when they should already be able to balance the budget. I support a free market alternative that makes health care providers compete so that they're forced to lower costs. I want to see the costs to be transparent and known before someone steps into the medical room. I'm also fine with giving some form of free healthcare to people who unable to pay for it but it will be very stripped down and only contain the essentials. People who pay more should get more for what they pay for.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,NinjaNerd99,t2_3q2if1nv,gt The act of seizing a business is a communist idea to some degree as you are saying It predates Communism. Every time an army or goverment seized a necessary economic goods or factories by force it's War Socialism. Marxist Socialism AKA Communism is the idea that everything would work better if the state practiced war socialism all the time. Of course the results are every goes to shit the longer you practice Socialism. America has a long history of practicing War Socialism in times of crisis and war. Typically with corporations we generally replace the leadership with someone willing to put the country first as we did with Henry Ford during WW2. Actually having the goverment run the factory is likely to result in a disastrous drop in output if done for very long. I predict that 3M will soon have new people leading the company who will comply with putting Americans first and that will be the end of it. The age of the multinational corporation with no loyalties to their home nations is about to come to an end.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,revanholdt,t2_o9gi3,Conservative is a broad term. As is Communist If you're saying you wan't no government then you're an anarchist. If you're saying you want very minimal government then you're libertarian. Beyong that if you accept that a government has to exist then the question becomes to what extent the powers of the government are limited or checked. Now we arrive at Communist VS Conservative You can be socially conservative and fiscally progressive OR fiscally conservative and socially progressive. If I had to be more specific Communism bleeds into controlling the means of production means of information dissemination as well curtailing civil liberties ala China. The US government is more of a balance between civil liberties and collective rights i.e you'll be as free as possible as long as your freedom doesn't endanger the rights of the collective If it does the government will use its monopoly on violence to ensure that it specifically does NOT its why we have 2A as a check against that but thats another discussion entirely So while you're right in saying that nationalizing a private business is what communists do I would argue that its a communist Idea but controlling the means of production in exceptional circumstances is still very much American and not without historical precedent

Skip past trying to buy new ventilators make deals with other hospitals to transfer patients or anything else and jump straight to sending state military to steal what you want.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,sendintheshermans,t2_1lbkc8bj,gt Poverty is a singular outcome yes but it can manifest from many different scenarios and situations. We aren t trying to fix poverty here we re trying to get people money so they can get through the epidemic. gt People can be poor for many different reasons and a one size fits all solution to poverty is not going to adequately address disparities between different groups of poor people. The solution to solving COVID 19 related deaths in rural white Appalachia might be a smoking cessation program. The same program in urban black Michigan would probably be ineffective because what they really need is a nutritionally focused intervention. I m not an expert on the specific issues here so I ll defer to you on that but why would we be certain the intervention for poor whites be less costly than the intervention for poor blacks. Even if you concede they are different in kind urban vs rural etc that isn t a concession that the poor blacks would require more money. It seems to me that AOC is making a different argument than you are. gt The same reasoning can be applied to this outbreak COVID 19 kills people in different categories at different rates for different reasons. Sure but let me use an example. All of the data show that most of the deaths from coronavirus are men. If we wanted to have a medical intervention would be aim it at just men Of course not since some of the people that have the virus are women and many men don t have it. We would aim it at people that have the virus or are at risk of being badly affected or have asthma history of smoking etc

Designed to be temporary because it's inefficient but sometimes necessary as it is in the case of 3M literally selling Americans out. Socialism including war socialism always hurts underlying economic structures which is why you really don't want to invoke it unless it's absolutely necessary and you don't want to continue it one second past the need for it.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Lloyd13z,t2_rbwei,Fellow non conservative though I wouldn t say I m a lefty either. Not sure what you ve seen on the sub or maybe you ve just browsing the top posts but our experiences have been quite different. From what I ve seen this sub is just the opposition answer to r politics. Both subs are hyper polarized and view American politics completely through the Trump lens every issue and thread gets focused around a stance of pro conservative or anti politics Trump agenda. If you sort by New and read through some commented threads you ll see this quite clearly. This thread will be welcoming and pleasant of course but I encourage you to dig a little deeper into the thread with less... nuance. I m sure the polarization has been emphasized even more by the influx of r the donald users though I don t intend that to be accusatory. It s simply the reality I ve seen over the past few weeks especially in threads around the pandemic. The anti democrat sentiment painted with dripping sarcasm and sardonic memes in the majority of threads is not what I d call even handed and fair The interesting thing and the reason I continue to lurk here is to see the parallels between the two. Both groups make identical claims about the other side being hive minds running election interference running propaganda and running corruption. Both sides attack opposing media with the shockingly identical claims. There s some subtle differences between motivations but it s incredible to see how the opposing tunnel visions have led to eerily polarized yet identical mindsets. In any case I agree that this place is great for getting the conservative pulse on issues. It also gives great insight on how the population is consuming news media because you ll come to identify trends between conservatives and Fox and match them to similar trends between liberals and the various liberal outlets. So I wish you luck and good fortune in your exploratory endeavors.

The average amount of water in a human body is about 65 of the persons weight. Assuming he weighs 200lbs and using well below that percentage at 52 then that means his body has 103lbs of water.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,SnipedYou,t2_33gty,This is a post I made more than a month ago to a Bernie Supporter as a former Bernie supporter to collect my thoughts There's a lot of former Democrats in this community tired of our unproductive public discourse and biased mainstream media outlets that don't report the news fairly. i.e There was a man who rammed his van into a Republican Voter registration booth in Florida yesterday and I see it on twitter but not on the front page of reddit or front page of other outlets. I voted for Bernie in 2016 primary HRC in the general and Romney in 2012 which was the first election I was eligible to vote in. I did not like Trump because I thought he would not be good for race relations in this country. I liked Bernie at first because I did like Tim Pool think he was genuine at the time discussed the impact of bad trade deals discussed how unfettered immigration led to suppressed wages of the low wage earners and discussed the exorbitant fees of health care and education. I have since come to realize from the Culture wars that there are a lot of disparate groups in the Democratic party hungry for power and there is a lot of identity politics that goes uncriticized because you are labeled a bigot if you even try to. As an American I grew up to value hard work individuality and to treat others as equals. In the summer of 2017 was when I started to listen more to what the Republicans were talking about. At that time there were 2 immigration bills going through congress one hard line and one compromise included border wall funding solution for DACA ending visa lottery program and I believe even made e verify mandatory and it got absolutely no democrat support. I knew at that moment that the party would not take the matter seriously. Trump at his last rally just said that the wage gains of the bottom 10 have been surpassing that of the top 10 for months. If the trend continues our Gini coefficient is set to decrease. The things I attribute to this are renegotiated trade deals cracking down on illegal immigration and removing incentives for people to illegally migrate here as well as the tax cuts which let businesses invest more and for big tech to repatriate money from abroad. Race relations are actually improving there was a poll released last week. I encourage you to listen to Trump's SOTU speech. His campaign this time around is focused on the African American community. Prison reform school choice opportunity zones and keeping the economy hot. Workers are starting to come in from the sidelines the labor force participation rate is slowly starting to tick up. We need 4 more years of this to continue. Trump treats me like an American and puts my interests first before the rest of the world. He values hard work and is not afraid to stick up for the Country's citizens interests when negotiating trade deals. He is way more moderate then the media would have you believe. I had a gut reaction against the travel ban when it was enacted but I see more of what it is now. Other countries need to cooperate with US Counter terrorism initiatives or get visas denied. Protection starts at the border look at some of mainland Europe. There are many terrorists attacks and they have a pourous border. I also had a gut reaction to the transgender ban at first but see it as more nuanced now. The transgender community unfortunately has high rates of suicides. A battle field may not be the best place to be but I would like to talk to members of the military to get their experience.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,GrandpaHardcore,t2_4zga1lm3,True we haven't but I still have faith we will recover. We've been through worse. I also stated that we haven't even scratched the surface yet considering how many good things are still working and running in the country and this will not continue for very long. April 30th at the moment and it may increase after that but at some point the country will go back to normal especially with the medicine healthcare system rapidly catching up to COVID 19. Also the being young is a 2020 concept had nothing to do with what is going on it was more of a statement on young people having to go through troubles and problems. Even with as bad as it looks now we still have a lot going for us that people just overlook because we've been babysat for so long. We will recover from this.

You want me to be sanctimonious. You need me to be sanctimonious. I'm not. As stated I'm nowhere near an expert. I only mentioned it in those comments to convey that I had spent some time seriously studying the subject of discussion not as a don't question my authority type of statement. gt Also genius I used the phrase I think which clearly indicates that it is my opinion and I didn't even suggest that there was any objective analysis involved. It is purely subjective and entirely conjecture. It's an admission of my bias. Something not all of us are able or willing to do Ya your opinion was a massive strawman based on dubious evidence. That's a step beyond bias. I'm quite aware of my own bias and am comfortable admitting it. gt Finally genius you think you're the first self professed intellectual that's come here with comments dripping with condescension pretending to be even keeled and offering objective reasoning for your concussions Well you're not. We get one like you a couple times a month or so trying so hard to pretend to be neutral but having his liberal sensibilities betray the facade. Ya I admit I was a little condescending however I never pretended to be offering objective reasoning. I consider myself an intellectual because I spend everday learning to be an intellectual. Doesn't mean I'm more intelligent than everyone. I'm wrong a lot. A lot. I wasn't pretending to be neutral. I very clearly criticized Trump harshly. I was interested in the type of response I'd get because interacting with people who hold different opinions is what we're supposed to do right One guy gave me some good points to think about and we had a well mannered back and forth. It was fruitful. You reinvented me as a trope then struck out to vanquish me with your cleverness. Not fruitful.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,caseclosedmagician,t2_5jxpzvq1,gt Deputy Peter Strzok referred to as the Espionage Machine Party. A small group within the FBI and intelligence community conspired to prevent the election of Donald Trump through the illegal use of FISA wiretaps and as an insurance policy to remove him from office after he won. gt Aside from the FBI's headquarters in Washington D.C there are more than 400 offices nationwide with employees who coordinate investigative efforts as well as work with state and local law enforcement on various cases. FBI agents collect information and give it to U.S attorneys or other DOJ officials who decide whether to prosecute based on the evidence gathered. gt Since the September 11 terrorist attacks domestic and international counterterrorism investigation has been a major focus of the FBI. To that end the National Security Branch of the FBI was created in 2005. The NSB's goal is to investigate potential terrorist and foreign intelligence groups operating on U.S soil and thwart plans that constitute threats to national security. These efforts are aided by provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act that removed barriers preventing intelligence and law enforcement agencies from easily sharing information. FBI agents also provide leadership and guidance to local law enforcement agencies so they can more effectively investigate and prevent acts of terrorism.

But it's a deductive conclusion derived from false premises. Poverty is a singular outcome yes but it can manifest from many different scenarios and situations. People can be poor for many different reasons and a one size fits all solution to poverty is not going to adequately address disparities between different groups of poor people. The solution to solving COVID 19 related deaths in rural white Appalachia might be a smoking cessation program. The same program in urban black Michigan would probably be ineffective because what they really need is a nutritionally focused intervention. Giving money to poor people doesn't adequately address the factors influencing poverty in different groups of people. The same reasoning can be applied to this outbreak COVID 19 kills people in different categories at different rates for different reasons.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,mastaxn,t2_2vldr,Here's the thing about factcheck.org The have a funny way of arbitrarily taking things literally or figuratively depending on the outcome they want. The article literally says that the Obama administration depleted make and did not replenish them. Then the Trump administration took over. Literally Trump inherited a depleted inventory of supplies. The statement is in fact true. But here come the factcheck.org writers to carry water for the Democrats. So since Trump didn't actively replenish those supplies and so they claim ignored warnings about it then he didn't actually inherit the problem... Suddenly because Trump didn't fix the issue before it became a problem the meaning of inherit isn't to be taken literally. Let's not even mention that in 2010 the Democrats and Obama passed a massive overhaul of the medical industry that placed significant regulations on medical device manufacturers... But I'm sure that didn't exacerbate the problem.

All them stated that it couldn't be proscribed to treat COVID 19 by requiring that the us only be for FDA approved uses of chloroquine of which COVID 19 wasn't on list. gt They've restricted outpatient prescriptions to avoid people stockpiling the drug. The feds have enough doses to treat 5 million Americans sent just by Israel alone and we have plenty of other supplies of that the Feds already bought up. We've got plenty. Resisting was not done out of a need to stock pile it. It's cheap and easy to make and we've got plenty. Not giving them out would only result in more people dead of COVID 19. Can you explain why they wanted more dead Americans gt Plus the FDA approved emergency off label prescriptions so that part of the restricted ended up not meaning anything. That was Trump going around the Governors bans when he realized leftist control states were not using the drugs. Once the FDA approved it it was no longer possible to escape blame for the extra deaths not using the drugs would cause.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,typicalspecial,t2_bs12c,Well I think virtually everyone in politics is guilty of that. But I think it's inherent to politics. It isn't the politics but the emotions they invoke. People get very passionate about certain political issues especially people that want to get into politics. And I'd say that is the right reason to get into politics as opposed to getting something out of it personally However it can be biologically impossible to be completely rational about something when it sparks strong emotions as any information that is in conflict with that emotion is either inaccessible or distorted. I don't know if she's dogmatic enough to be a zealot but then I suppose the definition has become more broad over time. That said I think it's less dangerous for someone like her to be in office as opposed to someone there for their own gain at the cost of others. She might have some percent chance of doing harm but the latter is a certainty.

Being Cuban just happens to correlate with living in Florida. Your argument is making that exact same mistake. The actual deterministic factor of having a negative outcome from COVID 19 infection is having an underlying condition. Race is correlated with income which is correlated with having an underlying condition. But there's no reason to base policy on race. Base it on underlying conditions which is the actual causal factor. Basing it on income would also be a much more coherent policy than basing it on race.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,geneeva71,t2_flr18,No you dont. amp x200B You cannot sweat while getting a Fever. Thats literally what your body stops doing to induce the fever. amp x200B mycarpe.com mycarpe.com gt Once a person s body initiates the fever process chemical messengers called pyrogens are released into the bloodstream. Pyrogens are part of the immune system response and through a complex chemical process cause a person s body to raise in temperature. Once a person has a fever they will often exhibit symptoms like headache malaise anorexia and other sickness behaviours. A person with a fever will also experience heat generating mechanisms like skin vasoconstriction which leads to chills and goosebumps muscle contractions shivering and a desire to be warm. Once a person s temperature reaches its new high setpoint and a fever runs its course the body lowers its setpoint and begins to employ body cooling processes. Due to the fact that sweating is the body s primary way to cool itself down people who are recovering from a fever often experience sweating as a part of that process. It is the body s natural way of cooling itself down and regaining its normal homeostasis. 2
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,NinjaNerd99,t2_3q2if1nv,What's a bizarre article. It used a bunch of anecdotal evidence attacking Trump and then points this out at the end gt It s true that some of the supplies in the stockpile that governors are currently asking the government to send to states were not completely restocked during Obama s presidency. gt For example the Washington Post reported on March 10 that the reserves of the N95 respirator masks were not significantly restored after tens of millions of the devices were distributed from the stockpile during the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009. Medical personnel wear the respirators because they can filter out at least 95 of airborne particles according to the Food and Drug Administration. gt Greg Burel who was the director of the Strategic National Stockpile for more than 12 years until he retired in January recently told CBS News We didn t receive funds to replace those masks protective gear and the anti virals that we used for H1N1. IE the cupboard was bare of the supplies we needed because Obama didn't refill them. In all fairness Trump didn't refill them either but we don't have any evidence he was ever alerted to the fact that they were gone.

Isolationism at the direct and known expense of real lives of people who made the mistake of not being American. In other words the same country that forced other countries to rely on it for manufacturing supply chains and security in the face of global threats is now turning its back on those same countries. This isn't just an exercise in cognitive dissonance. This is a decision by a substantial portion of the conservative movement to forgo any semblance of ideological consistency in favor of isolationist paranoia.

This means 80 either had an immunity or they quickly passed the bug as in it was gone within a few days Not enough is understood about the bug to be making such claims. That is fearmongering. gt It doesn't just kill the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. Yes people who have other health conditions are at risk. But if you sift out other health conditions and 65 the death rate is lower than the Flu. gt If we experience something as bad as the Spanish Flu wouldn't this be a good trial run to ensure that each society has a refined response that can be both swift and effective You just nuked our economy with the current policies. That is government revenue that is charity that is progress that was just destroyed by idiocy. That means scientists won't have the money for research in the future based on this. Closing down the economy is not a temporary problem it has long lasting consequences that could last a decade or more. And even when the economy returns to normal you still have the loss in productivity and wealth growth. That is permanent. You have destroyed future prosperity of our children and grand children.

Sure they are not responsible for Covid 19 but they and their propaganda partners seem to have been doing everything in their power to both worsen the impact of the pandemic and leverage it in the most cynical callous and partisan ways imaginable to strive for their parties power or their own personal power.

They own much of NY property and also Hollywood Studios are 80 percent or more China owned. Why do you think celebrities smear Trump publicly as if it's their turn. Democrats have been on their payroll for 40 years. In exchange for passing legislation and ecological regulations that cripples America's ability to manufacture and compete with China on a level playing field...they take cash for influence.They were also given Chinese Stock to ensure they looked out for their best interest in the future. This was Trump's first act as President to remove all of those useless Regulations and our economy took off. Democrats were told to get him removed at all cost or their checks will seize. They tried everything from sex scandals to Bullshit Impeachment proceedings....none were successful to remove a duly elected President. Since they did not succeed China used it last ditch effort to stop him from getting re elected. Unleash this China Virus and collapse his greatest accomplishment...the economy. They do not care if it cost lives across the globe. As long as it was secret until it had time to get to America....that s all they were worried about.

I do agree its crazy that insurance is integrated everywhere but as an individual for non elective surgery medicine is an area where making an informed decision without trusting a doctor can be impossible. There is all this bloat in the US system the insurance industry profits billions and all of that is coming directly from smaller and smaller pools of americans. One large pool gives the government all the buying power and following any other countries model will save the US so much money in direct costs and give the potential for people to be proactive in taking care of their health.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Blaxxun,t2_4rtqh,I think there is one one important aspect you are not considering. The initial mortality rate is not going to stay that way. As far as we know the hospilitation rate to intensive care is between 2 and 6 while the average stay seems to be 14 days. This leads to rapidly filling up intensive care capacity and continuously so. Going over it is going to be ugly. Going 10x or later even 30x over capacity is going to be an absolute gruesome shitshow of hordes of people dying in hospital corridors and at home that could have been saved. Think Italy but much much worse. At least that is what we are concerned with in Germany. And we have a very solid healthcare system with socialist' insurance for everyone. Might be interesting to you

So shouldnt your plea as a physician be directed towards other physicians I'm just really confused by this rhetoric that I frequently see. Please help me understand.

We know that people with these underlying medical conditions are more likely to become severely ill from COVID 19. There is a correlation between being Black and your probability of being poor. There is a correlation and arguably a causational link between being poor and having chronic diseases. There is a clinical and etiological link between having a chronic disease and dying of COVID 19.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,NinjaNerd99,t2_3q2if1nv,Holy cow Kissinger is still alive Wow. Also what a great article. gt The U.S administration has done a solid job in avoiding immediate catastrophe. The ultimate test will be whether the virus s spread can be arrested and then reversed in a manner and at a scale that maintains public confidence in Americans ability to govern themselves. The crisis effort however vast and necessary must not crowd out the urgent task of launching a parallel enterprise for the transition to the post coronavirus order. Exactly right. gt Drawing lessons from the development of the Marshall Plan and the Manhattan Project the U.S is obliged to undertake a major effort in three domains. First shore up global resilience to infectious disease. Triumphs of medical science like the polio vaccine and the eradication of smallpox or the emerging statistical technical marvel of medical diagnosis through artificial intelligence have lulled us into a dangerous complacency. We need to develop new techniques and technologies for infection control and commensurate vaccines across large populations. Cities states and regions must consistently prepare to protect their people from pandemics through stockpiling cooperative planning and exploration at the frontiers of science. gt Third safeguard the principles of the liberal world order. The founding legend of modern government is a walled city protected by powerful rulers sometimes despotic other times benevolent yet always strong enough to protect the people from an external enemy. Enlightenment thinkers reframed this concept arguing that the purpose of the legitimate state is to provide for the fundamental needs of the people security order economic well being and justice. Individuals cannot secure these things on their own. The pandemic has prompted an anachronism a revival of the walled city in an age when prosperity depends on global trade and movement of people. I disagree. Globalism is death. It's the whole world increasingly fragile and susceptible to disruptions. One major failure is likely to take everyone else down with it. Trade is necessary and good. Reliance on that trade for basic supplies is not good. We need balanced trade not free trade. You can try to rely on governments stock piling for bad times but typically governments are not very responsible about such things. We're much better off making sure that we have enough industry at home to support this nation in times of crisis.

They have Chinese scientists academia media etc. that have ties back to their mainland and are serving the communist party. They take advantage of our education by sending citizens to America to get an education and coming back to serve the party s needs. They have scientists who are also serving the communist party s wants using our research and data for their government. Not to mention all of our virtual data they are stealing very easily might I add. We are practically giving it away to them. Meanwhile the news is shouting that you are a racist for calling a virus that came from china the Chinese virus. Depsite China also letting this virus even arise by not having regulations on wet markets along with a culture that promotes non scientific medicine that uses these wet markets.

So I think we're pretty much done here. gt Of course because you have no clue what you are talking about. I spent over a decade managing large scale logistics operations. I feel comfortable with my knowledge of how to streamline distribution. gt You haven't provided any information outlining the standard plan. The Bush administration wrote the standard plan. I have a copy of it. I've read it. Obama tweaked it and updated it. gt He didn't have to. That's the point. You are following your own delusions and claiming that Trump was wrong not to follow them. Oh I forgot you are an expert in logistics during pandemics. LOL. I'm not. Didn't claim to be. Spent over 10 years doing it and cannot claim to be an expert. Just speaking to my experience. While I am not an expert I'm not exactly a novice either. Are you an expert in logistics I'm willing to be wrong here. I know that military logistics is a different animal than what I did in the private sector. I'm not sure what delusions I'm following either but ok. Honestly this isn't going anywhere and frankly I am partially to blame.

That's how dumb Democrats are. Voter ID laws require that someone have a valid form of identification to vote. When states started to give out drivers licences to illegal immigrants that made it even more complicated and that's why some people advocate for a special ID meant specifically for voting.

While the article does say there are lots of things in storage NONE of them are needed for this virus and for the treatment of those who have its symptoms.

But once you get down far enough into the article it actually does support exactly what Trump was referencing. gt It s true that some of the supplies in the stockpile that governors are currently asking the government to send to states were not completely restocked during Obama s presidency. gt For example the Washington Post reported on March 10 that the reserves of the N95 respirator masks were not significantly restored after tens of millions of the devices were distributed from the stockpile during the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Humptythe21st,t2_8gdz48w,Three days later Tim Morrison former senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense on the NSC wrote in another Washington Post Op Ed It is true that the Trump administration has seen fit to shrink the NSC staff. But the bloat that occurred under the previous administration clearly needed a correction. One such move at the NSC was to create the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation weapons of mass destruction terrorism and global health and biodefense. It is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented. If anything the combined directorate was stronger because related expertise could be commingled here

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Foubar,t2_tpsej,The surreal atmosphere of the Covid 19 pandemic calls to mind how I felt as a young man in the 84th Infantry Division during the Battle of the Bulge. Now as in late 1944 there is a sense of inchoate danger aimed not at any particular person but striking randomly and with devastation. But there is an important difference between that faraway time and ours. American endurance then was fortified by an ultimate national purpose. Now in a divided country efficient and farsighted government is necessary to overcome obstacles unprecedented in magnitude and global scope. Sustaining the public trust is crucial to social solidarity to the relation of societies with each other and to international peace and stability. Nations cohere and flourish on the belief that their institutions can foresee calamity arrest its impact and restore stability. When the Covid 19 pandemic is over many countries institutions will be perceived as having failed. Whether this judgment is objectively fair is irrelevant. The reality is the world will never be the same after the coronavirus. To argue now about the past only makes it harder to do what has to be done. The coronavirus has struck with unprecedented scale and ferocity. Its spread is exponential U.S cases are doubling every fifth day. At this writing there is no cure. Medical supplies are insufficient to cope with the widening waves of cases. Intensive care units are on the verge and beyond of being overwhelmed. Testing is inadequate to the task of identifying the extent of infection much less reversing its spread. A successful vaccine could be 12 to 18 months away. The U.S administration has done a solid job in avoiding immediate catastrophe. The ultimate test will be whether the virus s spread can be arrested and then reversed in a manner and at a scale that maintains public confidence in Americans ability to govern themselves. The crisis effort however vast and necessary must not crowd out the urgent task of launching a parallel enterprise for the transition to the post coronavirus order. Leaders are dealing with the crisis on a largely national basis but the virus s society dissolving effects do not recognize borders. While the assault on human health will hopefully be temporary the political and economic upheaval it has unleashed could last for generations. No country not even the U.S can in a purely national effort overcome the virus. Addressing the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program. If we cannot do both in tandem we will face the worst of each. Drawing lessons from the development of the Marshall Plan and the Manhattan Project the U.S is obliged to undertake a major effort in three domains. First shore up global resilience to infectious disease. Triumphs of medical science like the polio vaccine and the eradication of smallpox or the emerging statistical technical marvel of medical diagnosis through artificial intelligence have lulled us into a dangerous complacency. We need to develop new techniques and technologies for infection control and commensurate vaccines across large populations. Cities states and regions must consistently prepare to protect their people from pandemics through stockpiling cooperative planning and exploration at the frontiers of science. Second strive to heal the wounds to the world economy. Global leaders have learned important lessons from the 2008 financial crisis. The current economic crisis is more complex The contraction unleashed by the coronavirus is in its speed and global scale unlike anything ever known in history. And necessary public health measures such as social distancing and closing schools and businesses are contributing to the economic pain. Programs should also seek to ameliorate the effects of impending chaos on the world s most vulnerable populations. Third safeguard the principles of the liberal world order. The founding legend of modern government is a walled city protected by powerful rulers sometimes despotic other times benevolent yet always strong enough to protect the people from an external enemy. Enlightenment thinkers reframed this concept arguing that the purpose of the legitimate state is to provide for the fundamental needs of the people security order economic well being and justice. Individuals cannot secure these things on their own. The pandemic has prompted an anachronism a revival of the walled city in an age when prosperity depends on global trade and movement of people. The world s democracies need to defend and sustain their Enlightenment values. A global retreat from balancing power with legitimacy will cause the social contract to disintegrate both domestically and internationally. Yet this millennial issue of legitimacy and power cannot be settled simultaneously with the effort to overcome the Covid 19 plague. Restraint is necessary on all sides in both domestic politics and international diplomacy. Priorities must be established. We went on from the Battle of the Bulge into a world of growing prosperity and enhanced human dignity. Now we live an epochal period. The historic challenge for leaders is to manage the crisis while building the future. Failure could set the world on fire. Mr. Kissinger served as secretary of state and national security adviser in the Nixon and Ford administrations.

My main issue is with young people pushing this belief system and thinking it will turn up roses and it will just bite them in the ass and they will continue to blame the generation before them for this fuck up because people keep using generation gap excuses.

I don t give a single fuck what color trump is. I only care about his actions. And his actions are filled with ignorance hypocrisy and gas lighting. He complained on several occasions during Obamas presidency that the president should not he golfing and instead should be working for the people. Yet within trumps second year in office he already had golfed more then Obama had in his entire 8 year presidency. And he now has golfed over 2. 5x as much as Obama did in his 8 years and yet he is still only in his 3rd year as president. Obama also took far better actions in preventing the spread of the diseases he had during his presidency. So stop with the but Hillary but Obama but Pelosy and actually address the criticism made against your commander in queef. TRUMP IS PRESIDENT. NOT HILLARY NOT OBAMA. So stop brining them up the second anything negative is said about commander fuckwit. I was not on reddit during obamas presidency either. But I made many criticisms of him while he was president. And to this day I still don t regard him as that amazing of a president. Lastly I have never watched CNN for anything but the weather. And even then I have access to phones now so I don t even watch them for that anymore. Now pull Trumps dick out of your throat so your brain can finally get some oxygen.

Even with the drop which I believe is artificially lower than the actual state of the economy great time to buy It's still up on when he took office. The dow is up too and the nasdaq is way up. Seriously look into just hopping on an index fund if your investing strategies are leaving you with a lower balance than when Trump took office especially if you've still been contributing during that time.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,GrandpaHardcore,t2_4zga1lm3,A lot of people call it Wuhan Flu... are you new to Conservative or just trolling P Where did it start from sciencedaily.com I mean science seems to be onboard with it's origins... and how it has a genome sequencing 99 identical to a pangolin. eforum.org Once again Science seems to be very close to 100 on these topics. Or wait are you having problems with things being named other things also Is it COVID 19 or the novel SARS CoV 2 or maybe the Wuhan coronavirus... npr.org NPR even called it Wuhan Coronavirus and then changed the name of the title back in February to help confused idiots like you out I'm guessing. How about ASFV Do you know what that is Google that... How about MERS CoV Or maybe Mers Coronavirus Do you know what that is by chance How about SARS Cov or SARS Cov1 I wonder if you know what other names are for those Are you really trying to beat around the bush and come up with the concept that now... just now... you want it to be called something else because of no real outside influence like the news telling you it's racist and that it should be called this other name... even though you know there are names for other Coronavirus' historically But this is... this is where you draw the line eh

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Quiet_Days_in_Clichy,t2_3b31lzoq,Wow you're a real genius. When one is working toward a PhD one is an historian in training. I could be a public historian right now without a PhD and just a masters. You guessed my favorite sub based on the few comments I've ever posted on reddit in all the years I've had. Bullet proof analysis no way I could be more into other subs. Then your assumption that I indoctrinate myself with CNN and MSNBC total win. I would be willing to bet that you're quite pleased with yourself right now. But here's what's actually happening. I criticized Trump's ability to speak and you couldn't handle it so instead of trying to change my mind you turned me into a fantasy in your head then attacked me. I don't know you. I'm not assuming you're a bad person. You look at like 6 reddit posts I've made and decided you knew me. That's crazy.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,smapti,t2_7kc7o,That makes no sense. OP says people shouldn t be forced to NOT work. I said what if it s unsafe TO work. Commenter says nobody is forcing you in response to my comment about working... implying someone is being forced TO work. I get the point you re saying but that isn t at all what this conversation has devolved into. Also people dying is worse than people being broke. And that s to say nothing of the economic impact of mass deaths if the economy is your main concern.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,regollyek,t2_ga677,All these people copy paste the same 5 or so Trump misquotes and if you correct them they just do it again later.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,davidjschloss,t2_d6w7k,The virus that we re talking about having to do a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat as the heat comes in typically that will go away in April he said. Referring to the United States he added We re in great shape though. We have 12 cases 11 cases and many of them are in good shape now.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,purplebuffalo55,t2_19dukqav,I watched Jared speak and IIRC he was simply stating that states are making requests based upon what they project they will need NOT what they currently need. In that sense you can understand why the federal government would be prioritizing states like CA or NY that are hit the hardest right now. We pretty much shut it down It's going to be fine. There is nothing wrong with this statement. Instilling a sense of calm We're going very substantially down not up Again trying to instill a sense of calm but this is obviously false. One day it's like a miracle it will disappear I think any reasonable person could conclude that a virus wouldn't magically disappear It's clear he's trying to stop people from panicking. And this is their new hoax In context referring to the Democrats MSM hyping up the administration's response. Obviously not referring to the virus itself. I think we're doing a really good job in this country keeping it down. I would agree fully with this statement. Look at how many deaths per 1M people there are in other countries. We are doing very well especially considering the amount of cases we have had. orldometers.info utm campaign homeAdvegas1 I don't need to have the numbres double because of one ship I'm assuming this is referring to the cruise ships I don't know enough of the context to understand what was being said here but there doesn't seem to be anything alarming here to me. It will go away. Just stay calm He's not wrong. One day we will have a vaccine herd immunity and the danger will be gone. Hysteria and panic do NOTHING to help us. Look most of this stuff I can chalk up to trying to keep the public calm. I know it may be hard for you but at some point you have to be understanding of the situation. There isn't a single country out there who was well prepared for this. We didn't even know this could transfer human to human until mid January. Not to mention states could have been preparing this themselves. This is more of a failure from top to bottom federal to local and a failure by every single country. And if nearly every country is failing then I tend to believe that maybe we should be a little more understanding of our leaders. Hindsight is always 2020.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,davidjschloss,t2_d6w7k,I might be misreading your comment but we absolutely have done as poor a job as the Australia disembarkment. In fact we did just that. We had hundreds of people return to the US after the travel ban where they had to wait more than six hours to pass through customs at multiple airports because no one beefed up homeland security s staffing ahead of time. So people with no protective gear got off planes with active cases and stood around with hundreds of people. theintercept.com We had cruise ships unloading in Miami after passengers on those ships had symptoms of COVID with no screenings of the passengers. miamiherald.com We had De Blasio tell people schools should remain open and people should stay home only if they didn t feel well even though he knew by then that most cases were asymptomatic for up to several weeks but still contagious. usnews.com We have multiple state governments refusing to pass stay at home orders despite evidence from epidemiologists that they re vital to slow the spread. Alabama started on April 3. Alaska Arizona March 30. Florida only extended to the whole state days ago. They did nothing to keep people from being on crowded beaches during spring break. Georgia s order took effect today. Iowa has not ordered any mandated stay at home. Kansas the 28th. Mississippi April 1. Nevada changed it to an order April 1. North Dakota has no mandate. Oklahoma only covers the elderly. South Carolina has no mandate. South Dakota does not have any mandate. Tennessee has recommendations but not mandate. Texas left it to municipal governments until March 31. Wyoming says it won t issue any orders. All of those are weeks later than other states. This haphazard approach has had the effect of allowing the virus to spread and now that people have been continuing to asymptomatically transmit the virus it will be harder to contain.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,buckfishes,t2_hsn5i,The way I see it Skilled educated Americans want job security safety benefits and an upward career path farm work can't compete with the other options that offer these things just by paying a little more than average. Less skilled educated migrants coming from nothing are willing to settle for much less and can't compete for the jobs Americans can. I don't think it's a too good or lazy issue you could probably get younger people to work these jobs while they go to school if they weren't so rural you just can't expect someone with a degree or cert. to settle for a deadend job.

I totally agree the european healthcare system is being shown it couldnt handle this pandemic they allow illegals too and would kill their elderly triage The government choosing who lives or dies fucking sucks. Trump has a REAL chance to change our healthcare SYSTEM forever because its horrible. The prices are outrageous and so are surprise bills. I think if we came up with something thats less hurtful to everyday people who didnt ask to get a heart attack or cancer a stroke anything else we d be happy. OR ELSE.... after 2024 a democrat pushing m4a and not something more innovative abolishing private healthcare is stupid we will be in a lot of trouble because this topic will NOT go away. Change to our healthcare is coming because the newer generations OUTWEIGH the older ones. Right now luckily young people suck at voting but they propelled Sanders someone who hasnt accomplished shit as a Senator politician to look like Jesus because he wants healthcare for all. They even ignore his open borders giving illegals healthcare nationwide no cash bail other horrible proposals. We are in dangerous times. I like Rand Paul involved for sure he will come up with someone that doesnt impose on us too much or raise our taxes to 40 50 in the MIDDLE class like Canada Europe fuck that. South Korea has universal healthcare and rated the best in the world but I think we can learn something from them but not fully adopt their system. PATRIOT CARE IS COMING TRUMPCARE lmao

The ballot is not submitted unless the democrat is losing. The volunteer will go to a heavy republican area and say what a big fan he is of the republican candidate.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,SubaruSucks,t2_rt69p,This great suppression I believe is going to have the best chance out of anything else that has ever happened to be the end of the American economy and the United States and we know them. Complete government control over the economy running it into the ground as quickly as they possibly can and then people bow right down when they get 1200 which is supposed to compensate for months of lost wages. I'm not going to say that this was deliberately released by China but information about it was deliberately suppressed which is equally bad. This was not a biological weapon against America it was a psychological one and it worked incredibly well. The people of the United States have been brainwashed into living in constant fear of the short term believing it's governments job to provide services and equity instead of you know governing. And now the United States is ripping itself apart because they believe that lives now are worth more than lives a year from now. It's complete tyranny exactly what the second amendment warned us about and they didn't even have to raise a gun the people have finally given in. China has successfully used our own governments to turn America against everything that made it great.

Pretty simple to understand in my opinion. You haven't provided any information outlining the standard plan. gt The delay occurred because people failed to act in a timely manner. Looking at Trump here. You keep making claims that doesn't make them true. gt Right but the point of the mobilization act is for it to only be states and the fed. I already stated that the states merely need to inform the government of how much it needs and where when to send it. The government by way of it being the sole purchaser can then streamline the distribution of supplies based upon states orders. Simple logistics. I spent my entire career in logistics. I'm not sure why you think a free for all bidding war between over 50 competing interests with no obligation by private companies to sell to any of them is somehow more efficient than a centralized distribution plan. Not to mention the uncoordinated supply chain that results from such a system. Makes zero sense to me. Frankly you're the one that sounds clueless. Of course because you have no clue what you are talking about. gt Trump literally said he didn't need to nationalize businesses when in fact he did. I'm following it pretty closely. He didn't have to. That's the point. You are following your own delusions and claiming that Trump was wrong not to follow them. Oh I forgot you are an expert in logistics during pandemics. LOL.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Talmidim,t2_jmm9r,I'm not just explaining American Conservationism. Rule of Law is a main principle of classical liberalism and conservatism in general. If the government is not there to protect the citizens and the nation's assets during a time of crisis then what role do you even want it to have On the American side of things your government does have the right during times such as this. It's in your constitution. In regards to the unequal symptoms question you carry out your legal right to demand an adjudicative process to prove you are able and fit. This is still in place. The blanket restrictions are because of the asymptomatic transmission of the virus that is possible. This situation is about prevention and mitigation. It's not arbitrary.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,bad-post_detector,t2_51ym4nao,gt Should Trump talk or let the doctors talk Ideally let his doctors do the talking primarily and have him more or less repeat the points they make. The thing you quoted is not contradictory at all. I very clearly said he should be following the wording of his experts which is not exactly a call for him to do what he usually does. gt What in your opinion would change if say Fauci came out and said we're having promising results from Chloroquine Well for one if he's saying it he's likely not to oversell it even if the preliminary evidence is promising at the moment. He would have said not to assume anything right off the bat rather than after the president mentioned it which would have genuinely tempered the frenzy over acquiring it at least. There's zero shame in a president heavily deferring to experts on issues like this and it would have been much better to begin with if the message was unified and clear rather than having them contradict each other. gt Or in your mind would he just not say the name and journalists wouldn't press him for the name of the drug That should be up to someone like Fauci to decide based on their ability to set the correct expectations. My guess is that he would use this opportunity to name the drug so that he could influence expectations because it would likely be leaked or figured out by someone anyways. There's really no way to argue that the president didn't overstate the drug's promise considering Fauci has been downplaying it ever since. And even if you couldn't completely prevent a shortage less of a shortage is objectively better than a bigger shortage.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,jcarnegi,t2_hcdd9,I like how one leftist person says this and how everyone then went on to make sweeping and stupid statements about everyone on the left. Maybe they re average people with different values that genuinely want what s best but don t share your idea of what that is of perhaps they have an idea that despite their intentions would backfire. Perhaps we all have such ideas and perhaps you ll find that some of their ideas are actually better than yours. And perhaps it s not really in anyone s interest to point to the most extreme examples of the other side paint the entire side out to be just like that one example and then make absolutely no effort to try to understand their point of view or ideas and instead dismiss them outright as idiots out to destroy the country. This guy is an idiot sure. But how can you read something like this disdain it for what it is and then turn around and basically pull the same stupid shit. Get it together.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,BadgerCabin,t2_umxvb,Most likely people are getting tested because they have come in direct contact with an individual that has tested positive for COVID 19. If they test positive even though they show no symptoms they at least know to quarantine themselves.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,part-three,t2_3wuinelu,How many illegal aliens are there really What is the cost to our society if we don't help them And what about us just being good people I don't know what this bill really says and it's probably not in language I'd understand. I do think mostly in terms of being a fiscal conservative. Sometimes though there are things you have to look at in a different light. I think the biggest point is health care. And of course even when people bring it on themselves you can't let them starve in the streets. Letting humans get sick and go hungry during a pandemic because they don't belong here just isn't right.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,GGRadio1213,t2_i19b9,Then Fauci comes on Fox News and ruins that argument lol
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,OakInIowa,t2_3qlkoty8,Lot of idiotic posts here. The drug has very little indication of efficacy on a very small sample of tests. That is why Dr. Fauci recommends definitive testing prior to calling it a cure. Basically what is happening here is the believers think that since tRump said it it must be so IT IS NOT GOSPEL from your GOD.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Sideswipe0009,t2_1uhrusu4,gt Is it in our best interest to push a drug that is showing neutral results at best thereby causing a premature shortage to the people with chronic illnesses that the drug is proven to treat gt Good news is that the office of president has access to the best medical advisors in the country so he should listen to them on how to word things on this topic. Sooo...which is it Should Trump talk or let the doctors talk What in your opinion would change if say Fauci came out and said we're having promising results from Chloroquine Or in your mind would he just not say the name and journalists wouldn't press him for the name of the drug Better yet what is your way to tell people there's a promising drug to combat this without causing a shortage
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,GrandpaHardcore,t2_4zga1lm3,I understand that but being young is not a 2020 concept. We've had recessions and bad times that economically DWARF what is going on right now so this has affected older' people who were once young. That's the concept I'm trying to get across... this generational generalization bullshit needs to end sometime soon even though I know it never will. I might just shut up because it's actually depressing to watch people just give up on everything because they've been locked inside for like 2 3 weeks. The amount of people I've seen this week who are locked inside but going off about ordering food streaming getting fast food delivered Amazon galore internet social stuff watching movies with your friends over the internet and all of this amazing stuff... and then week 3 or 4 rolls around... suddenly their future lives are ending and dystopia is around the corner and we haven't even scratched the surface really. I'm just gonna zip it.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Quiet_Days_in_Clichy,t2_3b31lzoq,gt You weren't clear at all. Start with that. I plainly stated that Trump wasn't responsible for the state of stockpile resources which is why he should have followed the established pandemic plan from the start to flatten the curve and reduce need so the resources weren'timmediately depleted. Pretty simple to understand in my opinion. gt It was the process from the start. Delays occur during a pandemic with massive shortages on a global scale. The delay occurred because people failed to act in a timely manner. Looking at Trump here. gt I already told you that it's not just states and the federal government. What's most complicated is expecting the federal government to buy up all of the supplies and then figure out what is needed across 50 states with private hospitals businesses and health care facilities that need PPE. Are you really that clueless to think your solution is less complicated Right but the point of the mobilization act is for it to only be states and the fed. I already stated that the states merely need to inform the government of how much it needs and where when to send it. The government by way of it being the sole purchaser can then streamline the distribution of supplies based upon states orders. Simple logistics. I spent my entire career in logistics. I'm not sure why you think a free for all bidding war between over 50 competing interests with no obligation by private companies to sell to any of them is somehow more efficient than a centralized distribution plan. Not to mention the uncoordinated supply chain that results from such a system. Makes zero sense to me. Frankly you're the one that sounds clueless. gt Why haven't we done the thing you just elaborated. Trump literally said he didn't need to nationalize businesses when in fact he did. I'm following it pretty closely.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Lightupthenight,t2_5a6eu,One of the biggest problems is the coupling of the more expansive insurance with basic services. Doctors are often negotiated down to 50 of their original charge on visits however their costs are still static so they boost the price in order to be negotiated down to what they would normally need to charge. I think the integration of insurance into every single facet of healthcare is a bigger problem and I think it will only be exacerbated by giving government control of Healthcare.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Lightupthenight,t2_5a6eu,I fully agree with you. It's like some people see exploitation in the market and think See Free Market when the market is being manipulated. People will need to pay more for food however that money is going to be recirculated back into American pockets because American workers are being paid. Additionally this might be the incentive some farmers need to industrialize further and move heavier into automation.

For such a rich country it's quite odd that you approaching healthcare in the way that you are especially considering the amount of taxes you pay on average. Thanks Canadian for explaining American conservatism to the rest of us. There is personal responsibility for people to not behave like idiots. This does not mean the government should be using force to keep people in their homes. Communicable diseases have always existed and will always exist. This does not give gov'ts the right to stop people from living their lives. If people are willing to take a risk it's just that. Not to mention that this disease does not effect all equally why then should the solution be applied equally

China or Iran might take a chance attacking US navy ships now thinking that they'll be to weak to defend themselves. Worse he didn't have to do it. There's no evidence that the situation on the ship was being ignored and if it was the proper response would have been flying to Washington get a meeting with the highest ranking person he could get access to and resigning if they failed to help his ship.

Delays occur during a pandemic with massive shortages on a global scale. gt If I want the federal government to control all purchasing then a priori I don't want competition. Yes the states have a better idea which is why they communicate their needs to the Fed and the Fed procures it. Simple. Having 50 states compete with each other the Fed and private international interests is unnecessarily complicated and doomed to fail. I already told you that it's not just states and the federal government. What's most complicated is expecting the federal government to buy up all of the supplies and then figure out what is needed across 50 states with private hospitals businesses and health care facilities that need PPE.

This will pass the economy will recover there is no comparison between people suffering between unemployment or loss of business and serious illness and death it is absurd and insulting to insinuate it. This is a novel virus meaning the professionals are learning in progress we don't know how serious this could get. Hopefully they'll develop vaccines or other medications in the near term. But I prefer to trust the guidance of trained career epidemiologist to armchair economists. No we're not going to loose our freedom or liberty. In fact if Trump and the admin. didn't act in an aggressive manner this situation might have been much worse and like in the 30's with Hoover people are seduced by democrat promises they'd control the levers of government and push through more of their statist agenda and we would loose more freedom. These kinds of crisis are why government exists have faith in our values our country and our President.

Travelled all over Asia and Europe and have seen some of the biggest shitholes in the world. I'll never forget the time a kid in Vietnam came to me with his younger sister. He was barely clothed and his ribcage showed obvious evidence that he was extremely malnourished and he was asking for food not money food. And I will never forget that I was not the first person in line to give him food because my cynicism led me to believe that he and his sister were conning us and I hate how reluctantly I pooled my money with the group I was travelling with to help these clearly starving children. That's a harsh lesson I learned abroad and I discovered the importance of stifling my cynicism. So before you get all high and mighty and act like I don't know what the rest of the world is like shut the fuck up and sit the fuck down you assuming ass wipe with a superiority complex. Do you know what happens when you assume It makes an ASS out of U and ME. I don't care how smart you are the minute you assume I don't know what I'm talking about you are not a smart person. I'm also very knowledgeable of history and George Washington is personal hero of mine not the same time period you're talking about obviously but his life is a passion of mine and worth noting in this discussion I know lots of trivia about that time period and that of the Civil War.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,geneeva71,t2_flr18,Nope. You only sweat after the fever breaks. Or in the rare case were your body over heats beyond what it intended mycarpe.com mycarpe.com gt Once a person s body initiates the fever process chemical messengers called pyrogens are released into the bloodstream. Pyrogens are part of the immune system response and through a complex chemical process cause a person s body to raise in temperature. Once a person has a fever they will often exhibit symptoms like headache malaise anorexia and other sickness behaviours. A person with a fever will also experience heat generating mechanisms like skin vasoconstriction which leads to chills and goosebumps muscle contractions shivering and a desire to be warm. Once a person s temperature reaches its new high setpoint and a fever runs its course the body lowers its setpoint and begins to employ body cooling processes. Due to the fact that sweating is the body s primary way to cool itself down people who are recovering from a fever often experience sweating as a part of that process. It is the body s natural way of cooling itself down and regaining its normal homeostasis. 2 Heres the mayo clinc link you should have done btw which i know why you didnt link for Fevers. mayoclinic.org mayoclinic.org Depending on what's causing your fever additional fever signs and symptoms may include Its not a symptom of every fever only under certain circumstances do you sweat and primarily once you cool down as well. Stop trying to make excuses for this obvious lie. amp x200B Even you weak as Fevers listed as dehydration goes out of its way to suggest when its paired with other symptoms Fever. In general the higher your fever the more dehydrated you may become. The problem worsens if you have a fever in addition to diarrhea and vomiting. amp x200B furthermore the Water weight lost is regained once you drink. And a prolonged water loss of that level would actually inhibit his mental capabilities and create excessive thirst.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Obesibas,t2_6zrjn,gt Ok I hear you. which it did. I can sympathise with that. I have always been right wing but more of a right of centre liberal verging on libertarian which is about as right wing as it gets in the Netherlands. I was quite pro choice for most of my adult life. It was only when I started questioning the narrative I've been told my entire life that I started to become more right wing. I noticed that the people I have always had political discussions with my friends and family were suddenly not as open to different ideas as I thought. The first discussion I had about abortion with my brother turned into a fight because he just said I was a brainwashed wannabe Christian. Every discussion I've had about abortion since with the people around me with my roommates my friends family and even my own mother made me realise that their point of view is inherently irrational. Especially the anger they show when I question their logic not their morality mind you did change the way I look at politics. But for Candace Owens it just happened to fast for me to be believable. That is why I said she might have been faking it at first but sincerely believes it now. I know that a lot of things I believe now would have sounded ridiculous to me a couple of years ago. gt And you say what you believe. I agree with you on that. I've been through a very similar process myself. After you realise they are lying to you about one thing then it doesn't take much to question everything else. There are people that did a complete 180 on politics with whom I do not doubt for a second that they are sincere like Thomas Sowel. That man used to be a commie degenerate when he was my age but you have to be a fool to think he is just pandering. What bothers me about Candace Owens is that they tried to make it as a left wing political activist before she went too far and just switched sides. To a lesser extent I feel the same way about Dave Rubin. He tried to make it as a leftist media personality at TYT and when that didn't work out he suddenly became a right wing figure. But because Dave Rubin isn't nearly as intelligent as the people he somehow managed to surround himself with it is just much more obvious that he is in it for the money. gt Candace may have open enough mind. This could very well be true. I have no hard evidence for my allegation I just don't think it holds up to the sniff test. The JRE episode with her made me even more suspicious of her. She is obviously a very intelligent lady. There is no way she actually believed what she said. But for all I know she could have just felt like admitting that she doesn't know enough about it to form a strong opinion wasn't an option due to her ego. gt Now I think she is a fraud. I sincerely hope you're right. She has become a prominent voice on the right and I guess if she is able to open the eyes of young African American voters it really doesn't matter whether she truly believes what she is saying or if she is just in it to make a buck. I also want to express again that it is likely she does truly believe what she is saying now even if it didn't start out that way. The vitriol and hatred the left has shown here these couple of years will turn even the most leftist degenerate into a God fearing American patriot. gt My appeal to at your core. Amen to that. I have been a complete degenerate for a large part of my life. I even disliked Trump for a good while. But the Kavanaugh debacle has shown me that the left is not even remotely willing to work with the right. They would happily destroy your life and everything you care about as long as it grants them a political win. Pelosi literally tried to keep the American people hostage for her leftist agenda not even two weeks ago. So if she keeps sticking it to the left I won't mind Candace Owens being a loudmouth but if she turns out to be a fraud I want everybody to know that I called it.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Paiagrown,t2_ojcdb,I'm not lying and there is no point for me to. I know how much I weight consistently because I've been trying to put more mass on for past few years. It's hard for me to put on weight so when I get sick I weigh myself just to see how much I dropped. You say it's mathematically impossible but all you've quoted so far is basic calorie facts that you learn in high school. You don't take into equation of a person's muscle fat water ratio as well they're resting rate of burning calories. Water weight is what goes when someone drops weight fast. It's how MMA fighters drop 20 to 30 pounds a week before weigh ins and look like a meth addict on the scales but the next day look completely full and normal. When you're sick you drink a lot of fluids and usually eat a little bit of carbs daily. The high intake of fluids and low intake of carbs causes your body to begin to expel the water your body normally carries. It's what MMA fighters and Boxers do to cut weight and what pro bodybuilders do before shows. 13 pounds of pure fat in 3 days is next to impossible for a regular person but 13 pounds of overall weight is not hard for someone that carries a lot of muscle and is 230 lbs based on the other poster More muscle more water weight because muscles are predominately water so more water to lose.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Head_Cockswain,t2_kclyv,gt My biggest issue with your argument is just that you present R0 as the only metric that factors into how dangerous a disease is in your initial comment. Not true I didn't mention either metric directly because I presumed people would have a notion of how devastating Ebola is on the body. Then in my follow up and subsequent posts I discuss mortality rate much more because there's a stark difference between 1 4 and 50 gt total number of deaths Not a useful metric. I addressed this in subsequent replies. Mortality rate is the primary statistic for determining danger. If it's low we tend to not do much if it's high we do a lot more. This was why I said the following in my initial post gt We don't enact martial law for influenza. gt A lot more people wouldn't mind martial law if it were an Ebola outbreak. The implied difference there is mortality rates. I made a mistake in presuming people would understand the difference between Influenza and Ebola the deadliness of each is the obvious difference....well if common knowledge were as common as the name implies. gt relatively low death rate makes this disease even more deadly Facepalm https www.merriam webster.com dictionary deadly gt 1 likely to cause or capable of producing death How deadly a disease is isn't determined by how many people total die from it but the likelihood of dying if an individual gets it aka mortality rate. The cold isn't considered deadly because it doesn't kill people at a high rate. Usually influenza isn't deadly because it rarely kills the individual. Ebola is very deadly because it kills roughly half the people. You could say colloquially that the common cold CAN BE deadly but to say that the cold IS deadly is misleading because a vast majority of people who get it will survive.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,COVID-19Enthusiast,t2_5v9flhf4,gt As far as the gt 100 benefit payments I do think you have a point but alternatively alot of people just got kicked off their health insurance other benefits by being laid off so it could be argued that it is meant to offset that. That's a good point but with how much healthcare costs that seems like a poor solution to me. It would make a lot more sense to just have the government directly subsidize insurance rather than give a bunch of extra money to people who were paid so little before that they couldn't even afford insurance in the first place. For the 1 200 check apparently it's going to take up to 5 months for people who didn't file taxes last year with direct deposit which defeats the point in the swiftness of it's intentions too. Unfortunately the people most affected by that are likely the people most in need of it as well. If it were me I'd freeze mortgage and rent payments subsidize insurance costs give the business loans and sure up unemployment to ensure people can still afford the essentials and states can cover the sudden influx of claims. It seems so contradictory to try to stimulate the economy while telling us to stay inside and I feel like I'm getting screwed over for being responsible. My job made preparations in January I get paid twice the minimum wage. So now I can work remotely just fine while someone making minimum wage working part time is now being paid more than me to literally sit on their ass and watch tv. That leaves you rather bitter. I'm a liberal I support social welfare but you shouldn't be punished for working why should someone not working make more than someone who is Not only am I paying for that through my taxes but it's devaluing the money I actually get to keep. Edit btw are you sure you can't get unemployment Afaik you can't get regular unemployment but self employed people are still eligible for the 600. You should look into that.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Dr4kin,t2_x5gqb,Let's take Germany for example. Germany has nationalised healthcare unemployment pay unions if your buisness is big enough you have to have union members at your board free or inexpensive education paid sick leave at least 24 paid vacation days a lot of companies do more paid maternity leave paid overtime Ca. 40 hour work weeks etc. Germaniens per capita income is ca. 40. 000 and americas is 60. 000. If you are unemployed and worked long enough before that you get 80 of the average of your last three months of income for up to two years to get a proper job and not be forced to take the first offer. If you have cancer that can set you back up to 150. 000 dollars in the US and over 34 get cancer in their life time. The average German would pay less in healthcare in his working life then an American would pay for one bad cancer treatment. That most other doctor appointments and treatments would also be paid for isn't included. An average American pays more for his healthcare and treatments in his life time then an average Canadian. Is that because in Canada fewer people get ill or because if everyone is ensured by the gouvernemt the gouvernemt has a monopoly and keep prizes low and healthcare more affordable The US is the only country where something like healthcare is socialised and bad. The conservatives in Germany don't even talk about it because it is seen as normal and good regardless of your political standpoint. Something that costs the average person less keeps more people healthy is morally right good for the economy the person can work and spend the money on goods other then healthcare and good for the average wallet. Would you conclude that the fourth largest economy is lazy because they also have those benefits or the third largest economy Japan is lazy because they have those benefits or the rest of the developed countries except the US are lazy because they have most of those benefits Edit added a few more benefits

I know you're exaggerating but still that's just so far off. Overestimations of the impact of coronavirus are still estimations based on data and modeling. Your fun story about how we could all end up in a nuclear holocaust is based on nothing objective. WWII was not started because of the great depression. Obviously the economic situation of Germany post WWI contributed to the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany but it is ridiculous of you to float that as a reasonable series of events that deserves to be considered as legitimate as scientifically based models of infection. Shelter in place will eventually end. The longer this goes on the more people will have had the virus and those people will have immunity. Eventually herd immunity will take hold and we won't be at severe risk. Coronavirus has been in the United States for roughly a month. Viral infections take almost a month for the immune system to fight off from beginning to end. We are still in the first wave of infections and you're already to kill science backed policy decisions because if we hurt the economy too much we could all die in a nuclear holocaust.

Additionally there are also people in situations like myself who dont qualify for EI doing contract work was dont with a contract and waiting on the next I would argue that the 1200 should have only been handed out to people who needed it but that would probably come at the cost of time which defeats the purpose of getting it in people's hands ASAP. As far as the gt 100 benefit payments I do think you have a point but alternatively alot of people just got kicked off their health insurance other benefits by being laid off so it could be argued that it is meant to offset that.

Also he golfed 8 times during it all. It's not all bad news Trump's travel ban to china was a good move but it was followed up by a long series of blunders. The travel ban doesn't justify everything else that took place after like lack of testing lying that testing would be readily available saying the virus was like the flu saying it would probably be gone by April that we had 15 cases soon to be zero and Trump flip flopping a few times on the seriousness of the virus.... to name a few

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,0siris0,t2_bd7qe,The war wasn't lost by Germany at Stalingrad that is a pretense to say that the entire wars success was depending upon an offensive victory. If not for lend lease the soviets themselves would not have had the ability to counter punch into Eastern Europe and invade Germany. The allies primarily US led bombing of Germany and opening additional fronts in North Africa Italy and eventually France in 1944 drained Germany resources that would have been used to secure the Soviet advance. The US made its primary goal in 42 43 to defeat the Luftwaffe and if they did not Germany would have had more air assets that would been redirected East. Fighting would have been much more tougher heading toward Germany when Germany could secure its own air space which they struggled to do when the US and Britain started taking control of the skies. The hunting of u boats and intervention on North Africa helped keep British and allied access to middle eastern oil and out of Nazi hands. Remove those variables and if the Germans have the Mediterranean and North Africa they would have had fuel to counter punch a Soviet advance and keep their tanks and b109s fed. The invasion of Italy wasted Nazi divisions to recapture the territory and secure their south. And yes D Day and the Battle of the Bulge despite happening 2. 5 and 3 years respectively after the stall of the German advance in Stalingrad wasted German resources as well particularly since Hitler had sent Rommel to the west and some of his best remaining panzer divisions in the Bulge. In other words the Soviet's would have have killed as many Nazis if the Nazis could have balanced out their air and land forces on the eastern front. The Nazis may not have been able to conquer the USSR after Stalingrad but the same would have held true for the Soviets in reverse when invading German territory without US help. The war easily could have been a draw if the US stayed out of the European theater both military and financially. Meanwhile during the Nazi Soviet pact the Soviets were sending fuel and food to Germany while Germany overran Western Europe and started bombing Britain. It may be foolish to say the US won the war but it's also foolish to say the USSR did as well particularly when there was an entirely separate front in the Pacific that was led entirely by the US and the USSR did jack crap in.

But nowhere in the article does he explain why they re somehow uniquely immune from a highly contagious outbreak which when it infects a community will overwhelm local hospitals quickly. Why are we unnecessarily putting workers healthcare facilities vulnerable populations and pretty much everyone in harm s way for no reason His reason is well what s the point of living if we all have to suffer economically Because no one can afford to. Do you think restaurants are gonna suddenly open when people are going to just avoid them because they know there s a highly contagious virus being spread in their own community If no one is going to come out for dinner why is a restaurant going to buy food and pay workers to sit on shift Here s the answer there isn t fucking one. This isn t going away soon and willing it away with some delusional logic is just going to kill more people.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,You-said-it-man,t2_4rk091av,Ok I hear you. I really do. And I'm aware of how she became a conservative. She did realize after trying to setup that website how hypocritical the left was and their game and did change her political views. But it doesn't matter how you change your political views. Things happen that have you open your eyes and it can instantly set you on a different path which it did. And you say you can't really do a 180 on your political views overnight Sure you can. Maybe not if you are a hard core leftists who know what they believe and why they believe it. But not to someone who isn't really political who hasn't really spent too much time on the ideologies of the two. Who just believes the basic narrative but beyond that doesn't look into it too deeply. People in that situation aren't ideological but just associate with a standard way of thinking however dont really know what they believe. People like this can surely change on the turn of a dime. And after you realize how you are being manipulated to follow a certain ideology that you never even really looked into yourself like that you wake up and start to shift your political views. In the process you start to study the ideology on the otherside and do start to understand what you believe. Candace may have identified as a liberal at first but that doesn't make you ideological. Plenty of people identify as liberal left or progressive but don't understand a thing about the ideology itself. People like this can change overnight with just being presented with new information and have an open enough mind. Now I think she got wrapped up in the ego a bit. But that is human nature when you gain the spotlight. It doesn't make you disingenuous. I myself thought too much of what she was doing was fueled on rage for a bit and still is. But it doesn't make her fake or someone who doesn't believe what she makes it seem like what she believes. And she does have certain qualities that would allow her to succeed in politics. As long as she scales back a little on the anger and rage which I'm sure she would if in the political arena However I don't believe she is a fraud. My appeal to her has always been how she takes it to the left. I'm a sucker for that I admit. Personally I'm way less conservative and more about despising the left. I feel that the left is completely out of control and must be stopped. That is bottom line for me. And because of that I defend conservatism and will to the end. And almost every aspect of conservatism even if at my core I disagree with a lot of conservatism. So how conservative do I believe candace is Not sure deep down. But you can defend conservatism with every last breath even if you aren't conservative in all aspects at your core.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Mayor_Minderbinder,t2_4srxgt3e,I'm glad to see that you think that one individual should have so much power.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,redbaboon130,t2_a6y3d,gt youtu.be t 1345 So I followed up and read the update to the initial publication as linked by this video. The problems with the initial study persist in this update as well. Obviously there are promising things in there but these reports should not be taken as confirmation of efficacy. The data that was covered in the youtube video for example does not include a comparison to untreated individuals in the publication. That is just the percent of PCR positive patients in only the treated group that data on its own is meaningless. The original publication by this group did include untreated individuals as controls still not a blinded study but better so I'm confused as to why they didn't include the comparison in this update. Additionally the only piece of data that they have is that PCR test. That assay is obviously the workhorse assay for clinical detection of the disease but it alone does not offer too much information. At this point we only have preliminary reports on a small number of patients with a single assay readout seemingly without adequate controls. It's just too soon to accept this as an efficacious treatment and prescribe it widely. As for the supply I hadn't seen that Israel was helping. Obviously that's great but I still think Doctors should exercise restraint in prescription of these drugs for coronavirus. At this point it seems more appropriate to treat patients with it in controlled expanded studies rather than to have every individual Doctor prescribing it off label to their personal patients at large scale.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Clill-Binton,t2_szadp,My biggest issue with your argument is just that you present R0 as the only metric that factors into how dangerous a disease is in your initial comment. One argument you could make which I ve seen from a couple different epidemiologists about the Novel Coronavirus is that because the current R0 is low enough combined with a currently unknown but presumably relatively low death rate makes this disease even more deadly as evidenced by the fact that this virus has a reported death toll very close to 60k worldwide 7k US with a death rate that just surpassed 1K per day and accelerating according to worldometers which aggregates local news reports of deaths whereas the total number of deaths for Ebola since inception is around 11k from multiple sources. Keep in mind this thing is not over and areas across the world are in varying stages of impact so true death rate AND R0 is likely to change over time.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Quiet_Days_in_Clichy,t2_3b31lzoq,gt Don't start your comment off with a loaded statement like that. What the hell are you even talking about Err what loaded statement How is it loaded What exactly is unclear to you I'm not really sure how I could have been any clearer. gt Making orders directly from suppliers. When states can't find the resources they need they can contact FEMA which will then use their resources to obtain supplies which can be sent directly to where it is needed from the manufacturers or suppliers. I agree with this. I'm wondering why this process was delayed for so long. gt No it doesn't make sense because it's not just states that are buying this equipment. You want the federal government to control the purchase and distribution of supplies you want everyone to compete with the Federal government and think that will somehow solve the problem. Each state has information that the federal government does not have. There are 50 states and 350 million people and you think the Federal government is going to do better It's not about the money it's about the people closest to the problem making decisions before it Feds step in. Those would be the states. If I want the federal government to control all purchasing then a priori I don't want competition. Yes the states have a better idea which is why they communicate their needs to the Fed and the Fed procures it. Simple. Having 50 states compete with each other the Fed and private international interests is unnecessarily complicated and doomed to fail. gt Done what Why haven't we done the thing you just elaborated.

Guess what Italy didn't do Try to take the research for themselves and talk about hoarding masks for themselves. I don't care that people are Christian you daft cunt. I care that people are still going to CHURCH during this pandemic and contributing to the spread.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,COVID-19Enthusiast,t2_5v9flhf4,I can see increasing unemployment to 100 I see why businesses might need extra money due to extra costs from covid. I cannot see any reason what so ever to pay people gt 100 of what they made before nor do I see any point in the 1 200 stimulus checks. Keep in mind we now have decreased expenses on top of that since we can't go out. What do you see as the purpose behind this what problem is this solving I don't get it. Aren't we supposed to be shutting the economy down to limit the spread How do you shut the economy down and yet stimulate it at the same time It's like taking someone's car while offering them as much free gas as they want as a means of encouraging them to travel. It seems to me it's just throwing cash around to placate the public while leveraging that massive debt against ourselves in the future you get 15 hr for a few months now in exchange for 9 loaves of bread and social security cuts in the future. I don't see this ending well.

My state as of last night has had over 250k unemployment claims in two weeks with under 800 cases and only 18 deaths with a median age of 83. The fact of the matter is that this is something that attacks those that are vulnerable and we should be implementing policy and guidelines based on that.

So bizarre that I felt it also warranted a reply. In more detail gt Your information is incorrect this is on par Ebola. Ebola mortality rate is approximately 50 some sources state as high as 90 but 50 is the common figure Covid is somewhere in the range of 1 4 Ebola would be far worse if it's infected the same amount of people. Example If 100 people get covid 1 4 will die from it. If 100 people get Ebola 50 will die from it. These are not on par in the metric of mortality rate. You seem to be confusing total deaths for a meaningful statistic. Mortality rate is the primary meaningful statistic to determine prognosis danger levels. en.wikipedia.org The second statistic is R0 which is how communicable or contagious something is en.wikipedia.org There is a relatively close or on par R0 between Covid19 and Ebola in comparison to Measels or Chickenpox. However that comes with a disclaimer R0 is not a biological constant for a pathogen as it is also affected by other factors such as environmental conditions and the behaviour of the infected population. Furthermore R0 values are usually estimated from mathematical models and the estimated values are dependent on the model used and values of other parameters. gt they made her self quarantine in a tent for week I'm not sure you understand what self quarantine means.

Let s just hope we get a covid vaccine fast to get our life back to normal as soon as possible and potentially save thousands of those that are seriously at risk of dying from it and the hundreds who may be unlucky enough to die of it even when they are healthy.

There aren t enough doctors and nurses and we ve had to call in retired healthcare workers. Hundreds of NYPD members are sick some have even died. Firefighters too. How come people cared so much when thousands of New Yorkers died on 9 11 Why did we bother going to war then Why did we put soldiers in harm s way spend trillions then My friend s father was a Vietnam vet. My other friend s stepdad who s in ICU on a ventilator is an Iraq vet. Guess what New York City does fuxking matter. You people are so fuxking delusional it s insane.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Rightquercusalba,t2_9yy1tfm,gt I have questions. First I think you are correct about one thing the national stockpile wasn't prepared for an emergency of this magnitude and that's not entirely Trump's fault. Which is why following the federal response plan developed by Bush and further cultivated by Obama was necessary to flatten the curve. Trump decided against taking that route so we are where we are. Don't start your comment off with a loaded statement like that. What the hell are you even talking about gt 1. What are the better ways of allocating supplies Making orders directly from suppliers. When states can't find the resources they need they can contact FEMA which will then use their resources to obtain supplies which can be sent directly to where it is needed from the manufacturers or suppliers. gt 2. Why havent we done that Done what gt 3. Why is the Fed competing with states to acquire these supplies Wouldn't it make sense for the Fed to act as the sole purchaser and then distribute supplies as needed Heck the states could reimburse the Fed if state autonomy is a big concern for you. No it doesn't make sense because it's not just states that are buying this equipment. You want the federal government to control the purchase and distribution of supplies you want everyone to compete with the Federal government and think that will somehow solve the problem. Each state has information that the federal government does not have. There are 50 states and 350 million people and you think the Federal government is going to do better It's not about the money it's about the people closest to the problem making decisions before it Feds step in. Those would be the states. gt 4. Why is the Fed feeding reserve supplies into the private sector where they are resold for profit in an ultra high demand marketplace They said this was happening during last night's briefing if you don't believe me I watched it live That's not what is happening. I watches it live as well.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,AstralDragon1979,t2_zohhc,It s unbalanced to compare the worst case scenario of the virus against optimistic scenarios for economic shut down. If overestimating the impact is the responsible course then that is the approach that should be taken on all sides. We are already on course for a second Great Depression. The last time we had a Great Depression 85 million people were killed in the resulting World War but this time we have nuclear weapons. A full blown global war will kill 7 billion people. Is this likely Far from it but it s on par with the extreme unlikely upper bound scenario of 2. 2 million deaths that was repeatedly cited in the media for the impacts of the virus. If we re going to indulge in worst case scenarios then we should do it for all sides. Then it becomes a battle of competing tail risk extreme scenarios which is no way of making policy decisions.

Look I'm not necessarily anti gun in most contexts I just was pointing out that according to the most widespread albeit flawed global agreement regarding human rights guns don't rate a mention. If you want to extrapolate those rights to include guns well that's going to be pretty controversial. I fully respect that the US constitution has the second amendment and therefore does enshrine that right for its citizens it's just a reminder that Human' does not necessarily equal American' Many other very democratic countries have rights and liberties but do not include gun ownership.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Aco2504,t2_ny2zx,gt Darwinism in full effect all over this comment. And you have well meaning but statist bootlicker written all over yours. I don't stop supporting liberty for all just because a disease with a 98. 34 99. 34 survival rate is passing through. And even if the death rates were higher I still wouldn't stop believing what I do there are things more important than life. Liberty and freedoms... and those are why our nation exists today. If our founding fathers thought the way you did our nation wouldn't exist. They rebelled over too high of taxes and you're defending the literal infringement of our first amendment rights. I'm glad you'll be the first in line when a tyrannical government tells you that you need to turn in your guns for the good of the nation. Or to stop talking about certain topics. Or throws you in jail for having the wrong beliefs. I'm sure the millions and millions of people who have died to fight for and defend our Constitutional rights and personal liberties are really proud. gt You do realize that Corona is highly contagious right And that it can live on surfaces far longer than an average strain of influenza And no one has natural antibodies to it and it's deadly to more than just the elderly and young Yes I do. I understand everything about this. And it's totally and completely immaterial. You'd know this if you truly read and understood my comment. gt That pastor could have held service via streaming or asked his clergy to pray from home it was entirely selfish moronic and deadly for him to hold a service and I hope he rots in jail First they came for the socialists and I did not speak out Because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out Because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews and I did not speak out Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me. The purpose of the first Amendment is allow people to worship how they will. Without government interference. Could they have gone digital Sure. But they... SHOULD NOT be REQUIRED to... because the government may not regulate religion

In 4 years We re a third world country now Oh wait nothing significant has changed because alternating between Democrat and Republican presidents means change happens incrementally over time. Retards like you think the President has way more power than he actually does you don t even understand how our government works. I hope you understand that the people you think represent conservatives are fringe lunatics that the media parades in front of you so you believe all conservatives share those beliefs. Just like some conservatives think the psycho SJWs who think 8 year olds should have gender reassignment are representative of the left. The difference is more people on the left like your dumb ass are brainwashed into thinking the other side is evil instead of just wrong. I don t think people like you are evil just easily manipulated into believing something based on emotional appeals. And he s your president too unless you leave the country.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,GreatJanitor,t2_ap8ew,So...what reparations are they owed AOC and who pays I already know the answer to the second question the US tax payers mainly white people paying more money. As for what I know the ultimate answer nothing. Raising taxes taking money pandering to minorities but never actually delivering on those promises. The history of the Democratic Party. Honestly if it wasn't an election year I don't think you'd actually include black people in your statement. Reparations means war payments or at least it used to. Just another word ruined by the Left for the purposes of pandering. Now it is for COVID 19 victims before it was to blacks for slavery.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,calculatedfantasy,t2_1383fc,lol come on. We don t ban cars because all car accidents dont happen rapidly in a single short time frame requiring hospital care. The flu season doesnt cause anywhere close to the degree of hospitalization per unit time. How do i know because clearly NYC has car accidents has a flu season and it was nowhere close to being this limited and underresourced as now. Do you think all the physicians and nurses are just lying and that suddenly all the patients coming in requiring ventilators was no different than the regular flu season. I m not trying to antagonize you but the problem isnt whether the death rate is marginally higher than the flu its that its happening so fast and requiring resources instantly. I dont care about liberal or conservative viewpoints why label ourselves as such. This is a matter of thinking about the problem and trying to come up with a solution. We are all impacted by the economic downturn I agree we need a different solution. But to downplay covid s potential impact and to disregard the countless experts on the topic is foolish.

They all weighed in at night when I knew I was heavier so I pushed it the day before the initial weigh in. I was able to swing 14. 4 lbs in one day chugging milk and eating dry roasted peanuts all day. 180. 0 to 194. 4. I won the challenge but the cheap bastards never paid up either. I also did some some intermittent and keto before this and my very first week of doing it I lost 13 lbs. I was doing 16 8 fasting keto 96 oz of water and ZERO junk food and lost 35 lbs total 13 of that was my first week of 50 days like that. I was the best man at my twin brothers wedding and wasn t going to let him be the skinny twin on the beach in Cancun So back to Cuomo...count the fact that he has a fever is hopefully resting dehydrated from sweating during sleep without any additional hydration or eating and legit it s very possible.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Obesibas,t2_6zrjn,I've been downvoted heavily before on this subreddit for saying this and I will probably be downvoted again but I am super duper brave so I'll say it anyway I sincerely believe that she is a fraud or at least started out as one. The reason she looked like a complete and utter retard on the environment was not because she actually believed what she said it was because she believed it was what her audience wanted to hear. Candace Owens isn't dumb enough to sincerely believe any source that isn't a org isn't reliable. I encourage everybody who reads this to look into her background. Do you know why Candace Owens became a conservative activist Because she used to be a stereotypical SJW that wanted to set up a doxxing website for people that said mean things online and it backfired spectacularly. She said she became a conservative over night her literal words after the leftist activists were outraged about her doxxing pet project. Nobody does a complete 180 like that. Of course people can dramatically change their political beliefs I did so myself but not as quick as she did. The reason she became a conservative over night is because she knew the jig was up and a career as a left wing outrage peddler was over so she became a right wing outrage peddler instead. The only reason Candace Owens is even popular on the right in the first place is because American conservatives are just desperate to have young people of colour on their side because the left's deeply racist identity politics is working better than anybody likes to admit. Now downvote away.

California raised theirs to 12 and some other states have raised theirs also. If a business can really not exist without paying workers a bare minimum to survive with basic needs met then it probably doesn't deserve to exist. If its essential then subsidies come into play they are already used so heavily across different industries. A good example is Walmart one of the richest families in the US and their employees are in poverty require food assistance have no healthcare. We are just subsidizing their exploitation every time some health issue gets ignored until it becomes an ER visit or for any food assistance they need.

Doug Ford the Conservative premier of Ontario is disappointed in Trump. I don t think you realize how big a story it is in Canada and how severe the repercussions will be. I don't think you understand the serious repercussions in Canada if the U.S doesn't resolve this pandemic with Trumps presidency intact. If you want Biden as president and think he can offer Canada anything better when the rebuilding process begins you are a damn fool. The U.S isn't going to let Canada go without needed supplies we have a much bigger problem right now than Canada does. 3M is not the only producer of face masks stop acting like the fucking sky is falling.

That's how we do with it..

There are however significant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America where we are a critical supplier of respirators. gt In addition ceasing all export of respirators produced in the United States would likely cause other countries to retaliate and do the same as some have already done. If that were to occur the net number of respirators being made available to the United States would actually decrease. That is the opposite of what we and the Administration on behalf of the American people both seek.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,spsb98,t2_609qhx,First of all no one can prevent us from being affected at all. Anyone who complains about that is being unreasonable. A global pandemic was going to get here regardless especially with China blatantly lying to protect their fragile ego. What the US needed to do and still needs to do is work to mitigate the damage as much as possible. Then we need to have better preventive measures in place for potential second and third waves. The most important thing that the US should have done is not have its president publicly downplay the risks of the crisis. What Fauci said above is a much better of example of how this could have been handled in its very early days. He stressed that this is a serious matter but he didn't urge the American public to panic at that time. That is a much better public statement than One day it s like a miracle it will disappear Another example of a terrible statement was And again when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that s a pretty good job we ve done. Why is this so important Because a large portion of the American public trusts what the President says and when the person they trusts downplays the severity of a global pandemic many people do not feel compelled to make changes to their behavior. By early March it was clear that things needed to shut down for multiple months. Three weeks ago we should have been locking down and mobilizing like we are now. Just like Trump did a good job of cutting off travel to China very quickly he should have been quick to shut off travel to the hot spots in Europe. Cutting off travel to China was quite effective and it's why we started flaring up later than Europe. But by failing to cut off international travel completely the virus still infiltrated from hotspots that developed after China. The biggest issue that has prevented us from mitigating the spread however has been the lack of testing available. ESPECIALLY CRUCIAL was the lack of testing kits available in the early days of the crisis. The lack of testing kits is a complex matter that resulted from a number of mistakes made by the CDC FDA and White House. One of the biggest problems was the often mentioned late start For a better look into the testing issue here's a really good article advisory.com While not a recent action taken in the outbreak calls to cut CDC funding and cutting the pandemic response team did not help when we found ourselves in an inevitable pandemic situation. Additionally I believe that CDC would have functioned more proactively and effectively with more competent leadership in charge. Dr. Robert Redfield Trump's appointed CDC director has had a very questionable history regarding his opinions on how to handle virus outbreaks. For example Dr. Redfield was against the use of condoms and free needles in handling the HIV AIDs epidemic. Today we still have things to worry about when it comes to handling this crisis. Namely there are still multiple states that haven't put together stay at home orders. These stay at home orders have been shown to significantly decrease the amount that residents in those areas move around and interact with others. The social distancing that results from this is one of our best weapons against this invisible enemy. It's a pity that other states did not take action early. Props to California Illinois and New York for being proactive on that front at least in comparison to other states

She continued to go on about how trade school people aren t educated. That s when I reminded her that she s living in the basement of a house that is owned by someone that went to trade school and he also has no school debt. I also told her that just because someone goes to college doesn t equal being educated. I went on to say that someone that gets 60k in debt to be in a field that pays 36K a year isn t very edition my in my opinion. Went on to say if your Liberal Arts degree was so good she wouldn t be living in my basement.

If someone is rambling off the cuff they are typically perceived to be incoherent. It's easy to take his words out of context because it's so difficult to figure what the context is and that is a direct result of his rambling. He's transparently an idiot. Americans shouldn't have to decode the President's words. It is assumed he is saying what he means. Apparently not anymore. Also if he's so transparent then why does his adminstration fight transparency. Exhibit A Trump stated during the bailout bill signing ceremony that he will not honor the transparency clause pertaining to Mnuchin dustributing funds to business.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,_SkeletonJelly,t2_n0axcpk,Username does not check out.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Salty-Brains,t2_2i87q9e0,Ebola named after the Ebola Valley in the Congo. Spanish Flu not actually from Spain but labelled anyway Guinea Worm West Nile Virus German Measles Ross River Fever Marburg Virus St. Louis Encephalitis Rocky Mountain Fever Lyme Disease named after Lyme in Connecticut etc see a pattern yet Chinese Virus what's the actual problem here
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,skarface6,t2_3upit,Answer his dad dissented against the Nazis and he himself deserted from the German Army. So...nope Also there has never been a nazi Pope.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,-Horatio_Alger_Jr-,t2_x8aq6wa,gt Alright maybe not every single business is trying to make a profit but certainly a vast majority of them are I think that's fair to say. Unless they are a non profit company they are looking to make a profit. Even nonprofit companies are looking to be in the black Just because you are trying to make a profit doesn't mean that profit comes before all else. gt Look at almost every major coorporation in US history and you will absolutely find evidence of prioritizing profits over human life or good morals. No one ever denied that cooperations not all prioritize profit above anything but alot have morals and look out for the betterment of others. gt Anyone who believes in the myth of the altruistic billion dollar coorporation is either working for a billion dollar company or a liar. Again that is not true.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,skarface6,t2_3upit,And it s really good beer too.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,smarter_politics_now,t2_2ash6s5n,and we're the racists for whatever reason they pull out of the air. I know my place.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,I_son,t2_1xpd79cc,wow dude you brought up south afrika white drivers to argue for your point on a American constitutional right pretty based
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ivegotgoodnewsforyou,t2_15bj55zy,We had months of warning and still couldn't do better. When the virus goes back to China we'd owe them double.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,dabilahro,t2_6u79x,Yeah its tricky many seasonal workers do rotate industries like farming and tourism. Honestly I know this sub is against it but just decoupling employment from healthcare would be huge. Removing a major burden from workers and employers. That farmer paying 18 an hour probably cant afford to offer healthcare most likely for those few months and those migrants definitely arent getting healthcare either. No one will lose the motivation to work and contribute just because they can now go to a family doctor in my opinion. I hope at the very least this pandemic shows the benefits of setting the minimum standard for all people a little bit higher. Every country dealing with this now doesn't have to solve the issue of how do we get people follow guidelines check in for testing and not fear ruining their life. If I was in a position of lose my job and healthcare I dont know if I could do that I'd be terrified what if I had a family member relying on some lifesaving drug

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,zlex,t2_6p439,Again as I said I don't think anyone can answer your question. There isn't really an answer. It's not as though there is some magic number of deaths. Ultimately it boils down to risk tolerance and how we as a species evaluate and understand risk. We are inured to the dangers of the flu it's been around forever. We have a deep understanding of the seasonal flu we can model it we can accurately estimate its impact we have tools to fight it vaccines and anti virals and we have medical resources to deal with it. We actually do a lot to stop people from dying from the flu. With a novel virus we face the unknown. Our ability to assess risk is limited by the small amount of information we have. Some countries are taking chances others are not and ultimately it boils down to the decisions that state leaders are making based on the information that they have. No matter how this shakes out the future will be filled with people pretending they have a crystal ball and people who claim to know what was down the path not taken. I really believe that there is a false dichotomy taking place. As though a choice is being made between fighting the virus and saving the economy. But IMHO that is a nonsensical. If the virus unchecked were to tear through this country and actually end up killing millions of people do we really think that at the height of it people are going to be what...getting on the subway and going to their crappy jobs All we can do is consistently re evaluate as we have been doing. If this starts to slow down soon then people can get back to work. The economy will recover. If this doesn't then it doesn't matter what did or didn't do. We would be fucked either way.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,FlavorTested,t2_5o2x7axo,democrats Trump is Hitler Also democrats we need the government to take those guns
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,MaddSim,t2_z6b2r,Why can't people like this just stop being their asshole selves Put it off for a while. Gezus scum like this shouldn't be on TV or radio or wherever. Speaking of which how sad is it the CNN has Acosta as their WH reporter They should be embarrassed. He asks the same damn questions trying to goad Trump.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Jayer244,t2_1ptk8hue,I wasn't talking about this sub in general. I could've posted this in r therightcantmeme or even in r ourpresident if I look at the posts and comments there. This was just the first hate sub I saw on my way scrolling down.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,MasqureMan,t2_cpe7p,That s why you wait and do right by your citizens instead of trying to rush a virus.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,BelegTheStrongbow,t2_u4wto,A mistake typo. 850K is what I meant obviously and anything I claimed on apprehensions can easily be verified by the link I provided originally.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,MisfireHurricane,t2_57evtscu,Even later than that. She was shaming people for not going to Chinatown.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Java_Bomber,t2_4iyczawe,What's the pandemic got to do with civil disobedience or other emergency situations unnamed If it's to address the pandemic it should be written as if it was to address the pandemic not how they are saying it. Edit the wording is what people are getting bent out of shape over and they have a right to be bent out of shape and ask questions if they have them just like every American.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Kirito1917,t2_143cve,This is probably one of the single best Trump attacks I have ever seen him do. This is Trump at Super Saiyan level.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,zachster77,t2_13g2l0,She was speaking about Chinatown in San Francisco almost two weeks before the first reported case in SF. I agree her statement was a mistake but does that mean she s no longer credible to weigh in on the messaging we need moving forward She has a moral obligation to speak up and protect people. She spoke in February trying to protect Asian Americans. And now she s trying to protect the rest of the country. Folks on Reddit may be better informed but plenty of people get their news from print and TV and they still need to be reached.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,SurburbanCowboy,t2_34p0iohq,Clearly not.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,tfresca,t2_9dgl0,Where are the bathrooms Break rooms Any sick days Protective equipment McDonald's pays less but if you hurt your back you have a recourse and a clean place to take a shit if need be. Farmers are use to employing slaves for this work.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Bag_O_Burgers,t2_quen9dp,That cus in the 1700 hundreds it took 12 seconds to fire a shot not 12 shots a second. Why should we have more testing and training to drive a car than we do for firearms. Also what militia are you apart of You going to use that gun to fight the US army because they'll drop a bomb on your head. Edit 12 rounds a second is obviously hyperbole but figured I make that clear. AR 15 with bump stock clearly a much deadlier machine than a fucking musket.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,toprim,t2_2dngmtxs,Yes it does. You can be a conservative without being a cartoon character from a sitcom

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Hematophagian,t2_o1myo,10 different vaccines that have a promising result in laboratories are set up for testing worldwide right now. Red tape is slashed everywhere. Doesn't change the fact that testing and production will take another 10 months minimum.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,meat_tornado34,t2_57mltxre,There probably have been but you'd never hear because no one cares about DJs lol. Maybe that's why they don't get the Ellis Island Medal of Honor award with Rosa Parks. Only murderers get that.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,EmeraldStickyNote,t2_15tl52,Canada should take any action required to prevent the US from killing our citizens. If they go through with depriving us of resources we need to take measures to fill in the gap. Those measures will inevitably be harmful but that is not our fault. We cannot sit back and do nothing or this will keep happening. The US cannot back people into a corner and then complain when they fight back. We may be polite and compassionate but there are limits. We help those who help us.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,DeepGill2000,t2_3z520lnp,Lol she is going to make the liberals heads explode. You go girl I ll be paying attention for the memes.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,-Horatio_Alger_Jr-,t2_x8aq6wa,One person is doing their job and the other is saying he isn't at the same time leaving their state to suffer. One needs to shut up and do their job while the other should hit back because they are doing their job.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,gallowboob1984,t2_5ejm5ew9,feel that. she looked mad dumb on rogan when it came to the environment
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,dabilahro,t2_6u79x,Yeah right now in the current crisis if you are able willing or desperate enough for cash then you have to do what you have to do for sure and that 18 example we are using is definently better than other choices that are desperately hiring a largely disposable workforce. I'm mostly referring to how things run normally and how they will run afterwards and why it is a problem.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,BelegTheStrongbow,t2_u4wto,Very nice that I hit M instead of K and suddenly that makes me guilty of intentionally spreading misinformation. Even yet I posted a link that anyone could use to verify what I claimed and see the typo. I sure hope you've never made a typo in your life lest others call you a liar. How about you stop trying to score cheap points be civil and contribute to the conversation Not that hard to do.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Popular-Uprising-,t2_3su8w,gt This is why libertarians are a laughing stock. Only by people who don't value individual liberties but who cares about morons gt You care about means more than ends Almost every damn time. Freedom is a very important end unto itself and damn the consequences. Freedom is messy and it's not for the cowardly or faint of heart. If you want a parent go sell yourself into slavery and stop insisting that everybody else accept your version of safety.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Haganenno,t2_tntmq,This is the funny part. Libertarians are so utterly stupid and ignore common sense that they go around preaching for things that the parents of their own ideology objected to. It's the same how people go around preaching about Adam Smith when they've never ever read 2 passages from the Wealth of Nations.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Quiet_Days_in_Clichy,t2_3b31lzoq,Well it's an opinion so you're not required to. Apparently tens of millions of Americans think sounding presidential means sounding like a drunk guy in a dive bar 5 minutes before last call. I'm being hyperbolic but seriously his speaking abilities are the opposite of coherent and sophisticated. How someone speaks is often a reflection of how they think. I have no confidence in his intellect.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,jeopardizejasper,t2_5fy2mhye,I didn't realize the president golfing during pandemics was such a problem. can you show me all the posts you made criticizing Obama when he went golfing during the swine flu and during The Louisiana floods and during a bunch of other important times I'm sure you were just as concerned when the black president went golfing as when the whitee president did because because I'm sure the president golfing is just so important to you. I'm sure it's definitely not propaganda you're spewing cuz you heard it on CNN. I'm sure it's totally not motivated by racism.. pumpkin golf as much as he wants.

A true dictator would take all of these insane Leftist Dems and the crazy Leftist MSM and bring them all up on charges of Treason for the Russia Hoax Obstruction Hoax Impeachment Hoax and now the Covid non sense.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Haganenno,t2_tntmq,It's not even that people suck tbh. I live in a tourist heavy town that is close to a big city and a lot of people visit my town on the weekends. It's normal from a rational perspective one person matters very little and does not decide the total amount of visitors to the town. Thus an externality needs to be internalized by raising the risk of going outside for no reason t. going to visit a town with a lot of people for leisure It's basic logic which somehow passes by the crybaby libertarians. Go watch libertarian party presidential debate these are the people that are in this thread. Legit loonies.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Alex_gh,t2_9j152,I hope we Canada don't get petty about it. Any retaliation by us just jeopardizes more lives. Doesn't matter what flag they wear.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,coffee_and_ponies,t2_fn0bu,Importing cheap foreign labor forces Americans out of work which leads to a strain on the social safety net which leads to budget shortfalls which leads to higher taxes that consumers most certainly do not like. Also lower costs are not always a good thing. Slavery lowers the costs of goods but it is also shitty and should not be allowed. Same logic applies to destroying your domestic industries by depending on foreign labor.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,LonelyMachines,t2_616yb,Your taking me way too serious.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ArctiClove,t2_133idt26,That's fair and why I am supportive of subsidies like we have now. It's better to subsidize Americans instead of immigrant labor. But I want us to transition away from foreign labour to farm in the national. Whether we hire more americans or use machinery and new technology.

Are you illiterate I was responding to a comment not the article. gt And you're deflecting what he said by lambasting the effectiveness of stockpiling goods. So you do know I was responding to him yet you bring up the article. gt If you support states' rights you should be irritated that the federal government has a stockpile that they are unwilling to send to the states where you know Americans live. LOL... what are you yammering on about That's not what is happening. gt It's ok to say something critical about an administration that you generally support. You should start by making sense fellow conservative.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,wilkergobucks,t2_mdtvbkt,Not sure where you are from as some laws vary by state but yes one can own a firearm without much hassle. Most people I know aren t hassled for owing guns unless you are a fuckwit or paying too much attention to internet snobs. And no you can t own a tank under most circumstances so we all agree there is a point where our rights come with a bit of paperwork and necessitate a bit of due diligence such as filing for a permit to protest or obtaining a license to hunt deer. Its usually a product of living in a modern society with more than a few families per township.

Until that happens I think we should only have vital workers going to work. What happens if somebody unknowing exposes a Wyoming congregation on a Sunday. Now you have a lot more cases and more infectious people possibly spreading this virus around Wyoming. Is Wyoming equipped to handle this disease Is that something we want to risk I don t.

Sick stuff. One of the slogans was F ck without Fear Clear is here and it showed the LGBT flag.

I respect you I don't like people barking orders at me You're crybabies over the means and in that sense you're worse than mainstream lefties. You can't even comprehend the fact that one person has very little control of total quarantine enforcement and thus a person thinks that nothing depends on me That's why this needs to be enforced. But oh well good luck paying for all the increased health and econ costs at least nobody took your precious rights to go outside for two months. Your rights end where other people's rights start.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Quiet_Days_in_Clichy,t2_3b31lzoq,I have questions. First I think you are correct about one thing the national stockpile wasn't prepared for an emergency of this magnitude and that's not entirely Trump's fault. Which is why following the federal response plan developed by Bush and further cultivated by Obama was necessary to flatten the curve. Trump decided against taking that route so we are where we are. 1. What are the better ways of allocating supplies 2. Why havent we done that 3. Why is the Fed competing with states to acquire these supplies Wouldn't it make sense for the Fed to act as the sole purchaser and then distribute supplies as needed Heck the states could reimburse the Fed if state autonomy is a big concern for you. 4. Why is the Fed feeding reserve supplies into the private sector where they are resold for profit in an ultra high demand marketplace They said this was happening during last night's briefing if you don't believe me I watched it live

The brunt of it is I was merely trying to explain why people have different opinions. I wasn't trying to advocate or back either position more or less government authority That said gt Perhaps I should have said that it spreads easier I'll elucidate even further on my original point then explain why this part is relevant People have a more visceral reaction to something like Ebola partly because it's deadlier but also because the concept is more readily visible. Get into as much detail as you want about Covid it's not going to imprint as much on that section of the lizard brain ie the instinctual avoidance mechanisms No mass graves no piles of bodies with the flesh eaten away etc etc. It spreads as easy as it does because it's not as visible literally or figuratively. Long carry times non severe early symptoms low mortality rate and less conceptual social stigma. It remains an abstract and as such doesn't trigger anything similar to terror like with other diseases. Cognitively it is more difficult to take seriously. In the end people are going to think what they're going to think without some form of visceral connection. It doesn't help that the press and the government are wishy washy on the subject. I can't even blame them as many are attempting to allay fears and avoid hysteria. This makes the situation into a veritable sea of conflicting information at which point people again are going to think in random directions based on whatever predilections or proprieties or priorities they have. Again I'm not taking a position. It's not my decision to make. I'm just saying why there are diverse opinions.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,revanholdt,t2_o9gi3,I completely support the Idaho law. I don't want to be misconstrued as being in support of a dumbass policy to allow trans women to compete against women because I'm absolutely not but you're wrong. HRT does reduce muscle mass. You're absolutely right when you say that further studies are shut down The only conclusive research done on HRT and muscle mass is one that has been done on non athletes which shows that muscle mass reduces. Athletes behave differently because of factors like muscle memory where their testosterone levels can be low during testing but their muscles can recover strength after training even at abnormally lower testosterone levels. Additionally the amount of testosterone is not the only factor at play in athletics biological men and women have varying quantities of muscle fiber types fast twitch slow twitch lung capacity which increases aerobic capacity Q angle which can affect injury while running. There are numerous biological differences whose affect hasn't been studied enough for athletes and with a proper control group. You can refer to pdfs.semanticscholar.org pdfs.semanticscholar.org or several other papers which discuss most of what I've mentioned. The Devries paper is particularly interesting because it's specifically a review of all the research that has been done and points out the fallacies in that research. Again I'm not saying I support their policies I'm saying that theres hasn't been enough research done on if trans athletes compete at an advantage or not so the leftist claim that There is no advantage is completely wrong because the burden of proof is on them to substantiate a claim which they do on insufficient research.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,_SkeletonJelly,t2_n0axcpk,You could sue civilly. But yeah to be criminal battery in the United States intent is a required component. Negligence is actually a very specific legal term so I'm not going to get into the fine details but essentially negligence only applies when you failed to act in a situation where you were legally obligated to and it resulted in an injury or property damage. It's not just as simple as a failure to act in any situation and it's not just carelessness. You could maybe try and work it in under unintentional tort but you're probably not going to get anywhere without being able to prove the sick person knew they were sick and accidentally passed it onto you. You'd also need to actually be able to prove it was that specific person you're suing that got you sick which you wouldn't know for weeks until you showed symptoms. And then you'd actually have to have damages to be suing for. You don't just get free money. It'd have to be for lost wages or hospital bills. The only way your punching example is equivalent is if the person KNEW they were sick and intentionally went out with no precautions and for no good reason. And again you'd have to prove they were the ones that got you sick. Again it still wouldn't be criminal unless they knew they were sick and got right in your face and intentionally tried to get you specifically sick.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,khrijunk,t2_t563q,From the article you linked gt During the presidency of Barack Obama the national stockpile was seriously taxed as the administration addressed multiple crises over eight years. About 75 percent of N95 respirators and 25 percent of face masks contained in the CDC's Strategic National Stockpile 100 million products were deployed for use in health care settings over the course of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response according to a 2017 study doi.org in the journal Health Security. gt gt Again according to NIH the stockpile's resources were also used during hurricanes Alex Irene Isaac and Sandy. Flooding in 2010 in North Dakota also called for stockpile funds to be deployed. The 2014 outbreaks of the ebola virus and botulism as well as the 2016 outbreak of the zika virus continued to significantly tax the stockpile with no serious effort from the Obama administration to replenish the fund. gt gt During the presidency of Donald Trump analysts have warned the United States is not prepared for a serious pandemic. This idea that the Trump administration didn't know how many masks should have been in the stockpile is really reaching. Yes Obama should have restocked them and if this happened in 2017 we could be blaming him. However this is 2020 and Trump had 3 years to restock the shelves.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,obliviononahalfshell,t2_jdw0t,FTA Brewing criticism of the central government s handling of the crisis and the subsequent economic shocks have the real potential to be a threat multiplier to the Communist Party s legitimacy. This desperation for a deflected and nationalist narrative is where the aggressive disinformation campaign ties in. It is also likely connected to China s global ambitions especially the regime s fear that it will be blamed internationally for the pandemic in light of its botched initial response. Despite the rosy view being painted for the outside Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his credibility is on the line and the careful but genuine jockeying within China s politburo has already begun. The coming months will likely see no letup in US China tensions and other regional security concerns such as Taiwan and the South China Sea as Beijing attempts to distract from its own culpability and mismanagement of the COVID 19 crisis.

Not just the ones who would have applied for that job but everyone. You drive down the wages of a particular job to the point where Americans can not take that job because they won't be able to pay their bills. This is only a problem because we allow companies to import cheap foreign labor. Right now companies have to do very little to prove there is a worker shortage.

This is why the balance of power even at state level between legislative judicial and executive branches but state level actions are more accessible to the local population to change than the federal government which is supposed to be far more limited in its powers mostly to guarantee that states do not exercise powers that are not reserved for them and to ensure states keep the basics functioning as defined by The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,jpj77,t2_k19la,I was just posing the debate not siding one way or the other. I work in the energy sector dealing with balancing tighter regulations vs. technological innovation. A lot times you ll have Democrats come in and impose these much more stringent regulations that devastate a localized region or manufacturer type all in the name of less energy use. On the flip side Republicans do nothing and manufacturers aren t forced to innovate. In terms of renewables it s difficult to balance and quantify benefits when a good portion of the benefit is environmental. In my experience environmental economic analyses are difficult to measure due to the worth of the environmental factor.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,anihilistlol,t2_5wz6u,Nah. States should decide minimum wage not the government. Liberals in California are too lazy to work for 18 an hour because they would rather not work at all. If 18 isn't enough then the free market indicates the wage must be increased until someone will do the job. If not the job is not essential.

Because that's what this is. What you describe as poison is more like chemotherapy. Yes it's bad for me. But it's not as bad as killing 2 3 of people on the planet. That's looking to be a high end realistic estimate of mortality from this thing if we don't slow it down to keep medical facilities from overflowing. Aside from the obvious dead people that would have a huge long term impact on the economy. By slowing the spread below what our medical system can support and isolating vulnerable populations we can cut that number down to between 1 2 of infected which hopefully will be a relatively small percentage of the population. So yeah. I'm willing to keep paying the doctor for my chemo.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,novinitium,t2_60uquv06,gt But why does the media use the words death toll for coronavirus and not for other fatal phenomena That word choice is part of a narrative. I suppose it's part of a narrative if you choose to see it that way. They're using death toll because it's a toll of the dead bodies that are piling up as a result of COVID 19 tearing through the lungs of humanity. gt Sometimes that story is we all need to be under house arrest I suppose that's one way of looking at it. Feel free to frolic outside and socialize with whomever you wish if you believe your rights are being tread upon. Humanity has been experiencing first hand the ramifications of such actions but if this whole thing's just a media narrative then I suppose I can understand why you're saying the words you're saying.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Aco2504,t2_ny2zx,I don't KNOW I have COVID 19. You don't KNOW if you have COVID 19. The vast majority of the population does not have COVID 19. Only some people have COVID 19. Yet you believe the government should be able to force all of these individuals into their homes under penalty of law violating the 1st Amendment on the chance they DO have COVID 19 and they accidentally pass it onto someone who may be more suspecible than they. How do you not see that as unreasonable unconstitutional and government overreach I'm not being a monster by suggesting that our rights should remain as is. And you can't seem to differentiate between INTENTIONALLY infecting another person and ACCIDENTALLY doing so. What about someone who already had COVID 19 They are now immune. They cannot pass it into anybody. They cannot even be a carrier. Why are they having their rights taken away Rights are a restriction on government not on you. If the government can take them just because something bad is happening then we don't really have them. Let the Constitution stand.

We should increase the increase the standards on which we let people into this country i.e prevent tech companies from exploiting H1B visas but stopping skilled immigration is a very very bad idea. The CEOs of many of the most valuable tech companies are Indian for example. Hell the founder of Instacart which is an 8 billion dollar company that helps grocery stores deliver food is Indian. There are many other entrepreneurial people from other countries in Asia and Europe that should be welcomes here with open arms. Some of the people coming here to the US came here to take advantage of the free market entrepreneurial spirit of this country. They're better here then somewhere else.

He's NOT the kind of dude to be testing us for socialism or martial law. So the conspiracists saying all that can kind of cram it.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Head_Cockswain,t2_kclyv,gt Ah great another person who doesn t understand exponential growth. Ah great another irrelevant and pedantic straw man. gt saying that it s much more contagious is absolutely correct Technically correct but still useless. Much is not a technical measurement. It doesn't necessarily mean exponentially more It's a vague term. My intial point still stands. It's closer to the flu than a many other diseases which is why I'm liking to actual charts with data rather than but acktuelly I used vague words so neener neener That you've brought to the table. Getting into how exponential growth works doesn't change that as others have have the same logic applied measels or chickenpox for example are exponentially more transmittable than Covid. Ergo Covid maintains it's place on the lower end of the spectrum at being closer to the flu. My point from the original post Covid is on the lower end of the spectrum in mortality rates and R0 rates in comparison to the contageous diseases that really imprint on people. In other words People at large aren't as concerned with it as they could be. I'm being descriptive of the reality. Your little exercise in diversion doesn't change that. I'm not saying people should be concerned with it at X Y or Z level. This is the argument that you people are putting forth how concerned people should be. It's almost like you''re extremely offended that I'm not parroting what you're saying verbatim. You're not giving this the Politically Correct spin You guys sound like a bunch of agitated activists with activated almonds that we hear so much from on the left. Not so much concerned with accurate descriptions or letting someone have a discussion about the psychology sociology behind people's perspectives but trying to be authoritative with how people should feel. I find it amusing that after so many posts and explanation people are still attempting to argue against things I didn't say or imply. Bunch of reactionary opportunists that feel desperate need to be Correct on the Internet TM without the ability to even find the appropriate target for their desired argument...Maybe breathing into a paper bag would help some of you people or have a seat on your fainting couch and wait for the spell to pass.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,khrijunk,t2_t563q,Obama did not just hand Trump the keys and walk out there was a transitional period in which Trump's administration was filled in on what they should expect. One of the transitional events they did was a mock pandemic test for the new administration. gt The briefing was intended to hammer home a new terrifying reality facing the Trump administration and the incoming president s responsibility to protect Americans amid a crisis. But unlike the coronavirus pandemic currently ravaging the globe this 2017 crisis didn t really happen it was among a handful of scenarios presented to Trump s top aides as part of a legally required transition exercise with members of the outgoing administration of Barack Obama. gt gt And in the words of several attendees the atmosphere was weird at best chilly at worst. gt gt POLITICO obtained documents politico.com id 00000170 e50c d588 ab77 ed5ff3310000 from the meeting and spoke with more than a dozen attendees to help provide the most detailed reconstruction of the closed door session yet. It was perhaps the most concrete and visible transition exercise that dealt with the possibility of pandemics and top officials from both sides whether they wanted to be there or not were forced to confront a whole of government response to a crisis. The Trump team was told it could face specific challenges such as shortages of ventilators anti viral drugs and other medical essentials and that having a coordinated unified national response was paramount warnings that seem eerily prescient given the ongoing coronavirus crisis. politico.com politico.com So the Trump administration had plenty of knowledge of our nation's pandemic response abilities but like a former administration official put it gt He was never interested in things that might happen. He s totally focused on the stock market the economy and always bashing his predecessor and giving him no credit the person said. The possibility things were things he didn t spend much time on or show much interest in.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,fanofdonuts,t2_2moeqsmo,I am not an expert either. I read and listen to far too much about all of this. From what I gather if things are to reopen in May the economy can rebound fairly quickly. The problem is how long the shutdown lasts and what happens once we are open again. If it lasts longer businesses that could possibly weather the storm for a month or two will come back. Those that cannot wait that long will close and those jobs will take a lot longer to return. Would you open a restaurant in two months once others are closed I would not. The risk is too high. My other thought is that once we start working again things will get worse. It will spread faster. Just my thoughts.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,redbaboon130,t2_a6y3d,There's genuine concern that overprescription off label could hurt the supply of the drug and impede the ability of patients currently on hydroxychloroquine for FDA approved uses to get access to the drug. The published reports to date are a small sample size and don't show a particularly strong effect for use against these infections. If hydroxychloroquine has any effect at all it's not like it's death vs cured. It's more likely just that you clear the virus a couple days faster. I think it's reasonable to say that the immediate and wide implementation of this drug for treating coronavirus infections is a little irresponsible in this context.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,zlex,t2_6p439,I don't think anyone can answer that. But this just cannot be compared to the flu. That is over the course of 6 months and it is a estimate. You can't really compare that to laboratory confirmed cases. Regardless people started dying from corona when The beginning of March Last week we were at 400 deaths day. Now we're at 1000 deaths day. In 7 days the death rate has more than doubled. If the rate holds steady and doesn't grow any more over the same course of time coronavirus will kill 180k. Now maybe the virus will slow down or stop spreading or we will have a cure before then but left unchecked I don't think anyone can look at what is happening and say this is acting like a standard flu.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,CorneredSponge,t2_re0gnzq,I'm Canadian. 3M may stop exporting supplies to Canada due to Trump. But I get it. America needs these supplies more. And the thing is the better America does the better Canada does since a majority of our new cases may end up coming from the US thus it's only reasonable that 3M should focus its supplies in the US rather than Canada.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Stringdaddy27,t2_b1maf,My point is that it's a greater than less than argument. There is no price to put on a human life. Trying to equate lives to dollars is fundamentally disgusting and I hope you're not trying to go down that road. The argument that needs to be made is what will yield less deaths Period. That's it. Will shutting down the economy yield less deaths from every source or will it yield more deaths from every source A shrinking economy will cause starvation and homelessness which yields deaths. Lack of healthcare yields deaths. The number of deaths Coronavirus causes needs to be greater than that to shut down the economy. So far it appears that it will not be the case and shutting the economy down will be worse outside of major cities. It really ought to be looked at on a case by case basis and not necessarily from a general perspective.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,fanofdonuts,t2_2moeqsmo,No car accidents do not increase exponentially. I m not suggesting we don t follow what has been prescribed. The stats are starting to show it is helping. My argument is against those saying one life is worth the US economy. It is not. The flu kills between 12 000 61 000 people in the US per year since 2010 according to the CDC. That s with a vaccine for a few of the most common strains of the influenza virus. There have been 58 243 deaths from Coronavirus worldwide. I get that it will get worse. I understand exponential growth....I m simply saying we should put things into perspective and consider options. That s all. No one knows how bad this can be. Projections vary on a day by day basis. There are so many variable to take into account as well.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,seanpeery,t2_y1a1l,Yes Snopes did debunk that. I didn't say Trump called the virus a hoax I said what Trump said he said that he was calling the Democrats response to his response to the virus a hoax. Trump was very clear on multiple occasions that he thought that he had everything perfectly under control and that nothing could go wrong with the virus. Edit That's why I used the complete address he made on the matter in it's entire context. Like come the fuck on. How is Trump's words word for word and in it's full context a misrepresentation of what he said. Trump failed to listen to anyone criticizing him telling him he could do more and then sat on his hands while telling everyone that there wasn't anything to worry about because he was doing a great job

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Stringdaddy27,t2_b1maf,Have a nice day
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,TheVegimal,t2_63kxpa0w,Economy isn t dead just hobbled. A lot of us are still working full days from home remotely.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Stringdaddy27,t2_b1maf,Interestingly enough investments into renewable energy infrastructure such as solar hydro or nuclear is far more economically beneficial in periods of greater than 3 years. This is actually what I wrote my thesis on. If you compare the economic advantages of fossil fuels it's almost exclusively in short term periods of lt three years this depends on a few variables such as geographical location but can be anywhere from 2. 5 to 5 years average is around 3 These are good for reelection purposes but are poor for long term sustainable growth. The two biggest factors which make renewable energy technology investments optimal are the higher long term yield than fossil fuels and increasing jobs in the energy sector. I think where a lot of people miss the boat on that last part is that re purposing our infrastructure will take a significant amount of time and throughout that time nearly 3 4x the jobs of the fossil fuel industry will be needed created to handle the challenge. Most people do not realize it but the fossil fuel industry is largely mechanized and automated to an extreme degree. It also sends most of it's profits off shore to foreign countries which is another major problem renewable energy technology investment helps solve. Another thing people really never consider is public health and safety. China's smog clouds are notorious around the world and are a direct result of fossil fuel consumption. Long term consumption leads to these masses of CO2 that retain heat generating a higher average temperature which threatens the local environment and creates a lower quality of living. There is also the concern of contaminating water sources from oil and natural gas plants and distribution as well. The increased emissions and contamination yield higher rates of cancer heart attacks neurological damage and a lot more. There are a lot of major problems solved by a transition to renewable energy for both electricity cars production etc. I'd honestly be happy to discuss them with you as I've spent a significant part of my life studying this. What I will leave you off with is that it is mathematically incorrect to say that renewable would shut down the economy. It's the total opposite. Germany and many EU counterparts have seen economic growth in energy sectors due to investment of renewable energy. Heck even China has boosted their economy with it and they've passed by the US in that regard. The entire world is shifting to this and seeing massive payoffs so my question to you is why do you feel like this will work everywhere but the US Where is your apprehension

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,poppy_92,t2_a3av6,I'm going to be only speaking for myself here. When Trump initially made the claim there were very few studies among which one had overwhelmingly positive results that could substantiate. I get there are people desperate to get any cure but that decision should have been left to the doctor and patient at that time. Now that we have more corroborating studies it's definitely a good sign. I didn't agree with Trump hyping it up then when there was very little corroboration and I certainly didn't agree when that Governor can't remember who put a ban on it. I'm pretty sure everyone wants a cure ASAP. Optimism from Trump is fine but I think it should've been a more generic message rather than saying Hey this XYZ drug looks promising at that point in that context. EDIT There's still questions on how much production can be ramped up will there be issues for people who still currently need it as part of their prescriptions etc. but I'll defer those for later

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Aquaintestines,t2_r1pqx,Breaking quarantine isn't the same as spreading the disease but it can be if you do any of the following Touch anything someone else may touch without disinfecting it. Breath at any surface which someone else might reasonably end up touching. Spend any amount of time breathing in a poorly ventilated cramped area with other people. If you've spent two weeks in quarantine you're safe to go out but as soon as you touch anything you're contaminated and can possibly spread it. It isn't easy to not be a contagion. If your community takes on the project of a quarantine then it is just of them to punish those who refuse to respect the law. The same goes for people being forced to stay if there isn't a quarantine in place the law should be respected. If social isolation is the decision and reccomendations are the tool then that obviously signifies a certain course of action with the qualifier that the punishment shouldn't be severe for breaking the recommended norm. Recommendations respect individual choice fully while still contributing to the common project of reducing the spread of the disease.

Nonpolitical freedom is associated with autonomy not a society governed by rule of law Liberty is freedom bound by reasonable constraints within a society to prevent stomping on the rights of others in a rational way. This is why laws exist which follow concepts of liberty. You have a responsibility to a society to behave within its rules until you remove yourself from it. You may have the freedom to spread disease from consent but you do not have the liberty to spread disease from consent as that is harmful to society. You are required to quarantine. Common sense is not so common.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ngoni,t2_86rj0,C'mon now even Snopes debunked snopes.com the Trump called the virus a hoax talking point. Trump was referring to the democrats politicizing something else in an attempt to throw mud at Trump. Trump is balancing the very real issue that you can't expect people to sit unemployed at home indefinitely. We have at least 10 million unemployed maybe 20 million. NY's unemployment fund will be gone in 2 weeks. He never said things were going to be lifted by Easter he said he would like to but wasn't definitive. The reality is we can't continue much longer or there will be civil unrest. I agree some Governors are not doing very well. It seems many think the federal government will bail out their bad decisions but it should be abundantly clear as big and expensive as the federal government is it can not fix every state or even a small number of them. I hope he's tempering his Twitter because he needs to work with the governors and tamp down a panic. Maybe those conversations are happening in private. But I agree afterwards we need a very thorough and public analysis so we learn and improve from this like many Asian countries did from SARS and or H1N1. Edit We're probably going to be wearing masks every flu season now. That's just my hot take on this but it seems to be the biggest thing that's allowed Japan and South Korea to retain some normalcy.

I'm sorry you just don't get it or you think that there can be extenuating circumstances that justify ignoring those limitations. I don't think there's ever a justification to take away rights of individuals no matter how many could potentially die. People should be informed so that they can make rational choices but I draw the line at using force to remove rights. Clearly you do not. The problem is that once you start justifying the stripping of rights from the people it's too easy to justify it for other stuff. This time you want to do it because a few thousand more may die. Next time you'll want to do it to reduce gun crime or reduce traffic accidents.

Besides how many fucking people with deadly illnesses that can cause a death that can be mistaken for coronavirus while also testing positive for coronavirus do you think there are 100 would be a very optimistic estimate.

We still would have been caught with our pants down because of the actions of the CCP.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Rivsmama,t2_wutyg,I'm ok with this. I hate the dem plan to force everyone on shit state run healthcare and I think that if healthcare was completely privatized it would be more affordable but I'm a human being with compassion and as a human of course I don't want people to not be able to afford healthcare. I think that Republicans and Democrats agree on a lot of the same problems. We just have very different solutions to the problems.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,seanpeery,t2_y1a1l,I'll do you one better I'll give you Trump himself talking about how the Democrats were telling him that he needed to do more and that he wasn't doing enough but he ignored their criticism of his inaction as an attack against him. gt Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. You know that right Coronavirus. They re politicizing it. We did one of the great jobs. You say How s President Trump doing They go Oh not good not good. They have no clue. They don t have any clue. They can t even count their votes in Iowa they can t even count. No they can t. They can t count their votes. gt One of my people came up to me and said Mr. President they tried to beat you on Russia Russia Russia. That didn t work out too well. They couldn t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything they tried it over and over they ve been doing it since you got in. It s all turning they lost it s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax. But you know we did something that s been pretty amazing. We re 15 people cases of coronavirus infection in this massive country. And because of the fact that we went early we went early we could have had a lot more than that. And now in his own words because he failed to follow through we have a lot more cases. He took the right actions initially but as soon as the problem wasn't coming form China he stopped seeming to give a shit. He didn't even bother criticizing Governors that were clearly failing. Out of all the times to call a politician an ass on Twitter for losing this would have been the time. It still is. Even recently Trump downplayed it saying we'd reopen by Easter. He still doesn't get it and has to be actively stopped from making things worse at this point. All of the governors need to be publicly addressed on how they are failing their states especially on the east coast. But Trump isn't doing the one thing he is good at he needs to start that now. He needs to call out states on not doing enough. Executive order travel restrictions between states. These are things that aren't hindsight they're now sight. They're now sight that's been needed for weeks.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Revliledpembroke,t2_12i70fpf,In the big picture the 1860 Census census.gov counted a total of 31 443 321 people of which 3 953 760 were slaves. So slaves accounted for 12. 6 percent of the national population. The number that really matters is how many American households in the South had slaves said Adam Goodheart a Washington College historian and author of 1861 The Civil War Awakening amazon.com sr 1 1 s books amp ie UTF8 amp qid 1503593400 amp sr 1 1 amp keywords adam goodheart Using Census data to research his book Glatthaar calculated that 4. 9 percent of people in the slaveholding states owned slaves that 19. 9 percent of family units in those states owned slaves and that 24. 9 percent of households owned slaves. Households are a broader category than families. amp x200B So even by 1860 when slavery had 100 more years to become even more entrenched in daily American life than it already was less than 5 of people in the South owned slaves according to politifact.com politifact.com amp x200B So.... wow you're wrong already right off the bat. And no I don't see where you're going. amp x200B There is no official state sponsored religion no. But it was founded by Christian people on Christian principles. That is not the same thing.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,AWWTFYOLO,t2_13bo7cbh,What's happening is that people are home they're bored but worried so they watch the covid19 press briefings. Many for the first time are seeing a live stream version of a guy they've only seen post production edits of. There's no out of context rearrangement of sound bytes to totally change the narrative and they're hearing the stupidity and attempted manipulation by the press corps that Trump calls out live. This is the media's worse nightmare. The reason the dems are freaking out is the the carefully crafted fake persona the press has crafted is getting totally destroyed and many more voters are now realizing the extent of this disinformation campaign. I suspect many are really fucking pissed. Now the dems are playing their only card impeachment 3. 0 but their narrative is shot to hell by recent videos like pelosi saying on camera on February 24th that New Yorkers should go to China Town restaurants to support them instead of being RACIST like Trump paraphrase Many of those who followed her urgings are now deathly I'll or worse. That was almost a month after Trump banned travel to from china on January 29th. Now dems want to blame Trump.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,fatfreekicker,t2_nk7oo,It s not about money vs lives. I ve heard that trope repeated so much and it s honestly disappointing how many people lack a basic understanding of how the world functions. The economy has a direct impact on people s lives and a recession depression causes thousands of additional deaths through a variety of factors i.e deaths of despair people unwilling to seek medical help due to financial concerns and increased criminality out of financial desperation. We won t know when we cross the line because it takes a while for these factors to kick in but at some point the economic destruction caused by our preventative measures could very well lead to the deaths of more people than the virus.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Churn,t2_36sc9,agreed my conservative friends and I have had this same discussion. We use facts and data from any source to reason our way to an opinion. The few liberals I know argue and try to make their case based solely on how they feel something should be often in spite of unintended but obvious consequences. The weird part is that you can discuss the two different ways of reasoning with the conservatives they get it Try to point out to a liberal that they are using emotions and feelings instead of reasoning with facts and logic they'll just stare at you like you're an alien that just fell from the sky. They see us as heartless for thinking like a robot. This makes it so ironic to me that liberal politicians all use the same phrase over and over again. We need action based on science and the data whether they are talking about coronavirus or climate change it's always action based on science and the data or the proven science and the data support my vision. If you haven't noticed this just watch how often you see this phrase used.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,wandering-monster,t2_10qkw7,So I know this won't play well here but this is why many folks think that basic democratic socialist policies are good to have in place. There are people like yourself who are suffering through absolutely no fault of their own. There are people like myself who are mostly just inconvenienced. And there there are people profiting off this crisis. I'd be fine with raising my taxes forever to make sure we have support for folks like yourself in times like this. For all I know next time it will be me but I'm also okay with the idea that I might pay in my whole life and be lucky enough never to need help. I'd especially like to see companies reaping disproportionate profits pay appropriate taxes and use it to save those small businesses. We've had high taxes before and people still built great industries in America. If we had that kind of capital to distribute now we could save all those small businesses shutting down through no fault of their own. I hope you get through this. Stay safe and good luck.

As for your question How about my buddy's legs and not an elephant's dick long byzantine process to get disability or preventative treatment That'd be a nice start. How about actually funding the VA instead of using it as a bargaining chip How about my other buddy's life forever gone due to a completely bullshit war How about my friend that blew his brains out after being home for 2 years I'm sure they were glad for all those benefits Yeah they knew what they signed up for but they also signed up for a promise that wasn't kept and the people voting to rescind those promises were usually but not always Republicans. The GI Bill and VA Loan sure but everything else is like pulling teeth. It's like saying you are going to give me a Christmas present but the present is underneath a landmine and I have to figure out a way to diffuse the mine before I can dig the thing up. I may die in the process and many people do. And it's a constant battle which was supposed to end when you got back. Also those benefits you mention are pretty much the standard for all of our Allies' citizens and many consider themselves conservative. If the military has done anything it showed me that actions speak louder than words and that's all I heard from the R eps that shook our hand and looked at us in the eye just words.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,SquirrelsAreGreat,t2_3pt00uk3,gt Human life is valuable because of freedom You're not thinking for yourself. You're repeating phrases and not understanding what you're saying. Freedom to kill someone isn't the purpose of life. Obviously people will kill their children if it's illegal or not. That's why there are dumpster babies and smothered children and people who kill their kids randomly. That doesn't make it an ok thing to do. Human life is valuable because humans have potential to do amazing things like create and learn and explore. Every single human regardless of their origin has potential. When you murder someone you end their potential right then and there for selfish reasons. There's no right to murder despite many people wanting to kill others.

You'd be an idiot to believe that because the numbers haven't surpassed the flu of 2017 that it can't be worse. That's a really dumb argument. It's like saying to a guy who hit 10 HR's in his first 10 at bats of an MLB season that he isn't as good as Barry Bonds because Bonds hit 73 HR's in an entire season. You're comparing 3 games to a whole season. That's some idiot level shit stop doing it.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,localdesertbum,t2_8db8p03,I get what you re trying to say with the Flu Ebola scale. Corona is really nothing like Ebola but that s what makes it more dangerous really. Ebola leaves its victims basically immobile Corona has an incubation period where the person isn t feeling the sickness yet which allows the carrier to spread it even more which is even more dangerous considering how contagious it is as well as it s higher death rate compared to the flu. Corona may fall into the same category as the seasonal Flu similar to how dogs and wolves are of the same Genus canines but one is much more dangerous than the other. I d have to disagree that this pandemic and by extension the shelter in place orders given by states are not a matter of subjectivity.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,GrandpaHardcore,t2_4zga1lm3,It would be very hard to run those numbers and would result in numbers similar to how they've been predicting Wuhan Flu deaths where they start out with 2. 2 million and then drop down to 200k or whatever the new estimate is. They could find a miracle cure next week and or a vaccine next month and the adjusted inflating would never account for that sort of stuff. As of now we're doing good but we could be in a lot worse spot... imagine if delivery services were shut down over the pandemic Once you stop and realize how many things that are still working that are keeping your lives somewhat normal and sane and then imagine if they were shutdown that will be when things get scary. Oh ya Spanish flu was crazy and I've seen people compare them to the Wuhan flu but in modern times people just move around way more than they did in 1918. Airplanes trains cars etc. I hope it ends soon though... I'm getting tired of staying cooped up non stop. P

I have no idea what the other person is doing but it's usually some cousin or nibling born here presumably not working and waiting to collect those sweet Social Security benefits from their taxpaying relative who will get none. My friends in service type industries note that the illegals who work all do so with someone else's SSN. They're all hired the legitimate way and their taxes are taken out of their paychecks automatically. Owners all know this and turn a blind eye.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,GrandpaHardcore,t2_4zga1lm3,As I explained to someone else there is this thing called the GDP to Debt ratio which basically shows how well we're doing and as an example right after World War II ended we had a ratio of 121 Prior to this we had a ratio of 107 so we were doing better than we should have been and as of March 2020 we are at 91 As an example of how bad things have been in our country during the big crisis in the 1970s that ratio dropped down to 31 at it's lowest and 40 at it's highest so technically we're still doing quite well. Also in 2019 most economists were estimating that we would be entering a recession because of how well our economy has been doing and the guess was between 2020 and 2021 so once again technically we would could have been facing these economy issues regardless of the Wuhan Flu or not. I have not lost my job but I do remember what happened in the 70s and it sucked. A few of my family members have lost their jobs in the past week or two and I've helped them get replacement jobs doing the jobs that are risky but necessary during this crisis such as delivery and the like. Sorry if I sound a little too logical no empathy about this but like someone pointed out that no one takes notice of how many people die from cars or alcohol etc. in the same beat very few people worry about people losing jobs going bankrupt during a recession.

Worked in a few places like this outgoing shift is supposed to restock and incoming shift is supposed to double check. But when something comes up short in the middle of the shift guess who's fault it is yup the incoming shift for not ensuring it was stocked. This admin had 3 years to double check the stock of supplies. Yeah the previous ones were supposed to restock it but they didn't Yeah you can yell at them but it was shorted on this admin's watch.

You really think having 6 household slaves got him his power influence and wealth The closest he came to growing his wealth off slavery was running ads in his newspaper for it but he also ran ads for abolition groups so I think that was just more a case of him running ads for whoever paid him. You're acting as if he ran a massive plantation or slave trade and made his money off of torturing slaves in order to prove your point. In reality he had a small number of well treated household slaves he released upon his death. He was also an abolitionist by the time he died. I'm sure you would've been super moral at the time and gone against the grain lmfao.

Technically speaking our economy is still doing very well because our GDP to Debt ratio was at 107 before all of this took place so we were doing better than we should have been doing and now we're dropping down to 91 As an example during the big crisis in the 70s where people were lining up for food and gasoline our GDP to Debt Ratio was ranging from 31 to 40 Most economists were also predicting that between 2020 and 2021 that there would be another recession and our economy would have tanked out during this time and most likely the same amount of people losing their jobs would still be losing them. In the same light when we have a recession very few people seem to care about jobs being saved and what not much in the same light that you've said people don't acknowledge deaths by alcohol etc. amp x200B The media is still overhyping a lot of this and yes I realize people are losing their jobs and people are declaring bankruptcies and I am empathetic to that and not denying it's existence but during a typical recession the same thing would be happening anyways.

There is a reason that the UK briefly considered doing this and then quickly reversed their decision to actually mitigate the spread through social distancing and shutting down nonessential business. Letting this virus spread without doing anything pretty much guarantees that the entire healthcare system will be shutdown for months many millions of Americans will die and mass panic will most definitely set in on a scale much worse than it is currently.

Example What do you think about Trump me He's a racist biggot not very smart etc.. them Ok so as a person you don't like him what about his policies and the things he's accomplished since taking the office me What You've got to be kidding...he hasn't accomplished anything as President them Really What about allowing Veterans to see any doctor when VA hospitals are too busy to treat them What about allowing the VA to fire abusive employees of the administration What about giving fatally ill people the right to try experimental drugs that may save their lives There's a lot more but have you heard of any of these me No what Was it actually him though I don't know I'll have to check on that. them Another example when I'm watching the democratic debates I'll ask my kids to message their most liberal friends to see what they think about what's happening on the debate stage. Everyone one of them every time doesn't watch. It's their political party and they don't even watch. Which brings me to another realization. To remain a Democrat you've got to almost purposefully avoid learning anything about your own party or you'd seriously question why you support them.

Enable faster production of equipment. Trump is by working alongside private businesses. Cut red tape allowing a vaccine to get to market faster. Trump is by allowing the FDA is produce a vaccine within one year or so. In the meantime allow for clinical trials to move forward faster than normal.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,calculatedfantasy,t2_1383fc,All reasonable points. The fact that we do not understand the true virulence of the condition is a reason to study this in depth. But I defer to the infectious disease experts who have spent years studying this for recommendations. Its nice to think we know whats going on in such a complex topic but when the experts suggest an approach I give more merit to that. I dont assume they ve ignored the data you present. I anticipate the fear is the very real possibility that even with a low death rate there is a slightly higher overall hospitalization rate. If a large population gets infected even though the vast majority remain unaffected a significant minority will still require hospital services.

But in the end if you live on a diet of Doritos and Mountain Dew you are only affecting yourself. Every person that catches COVID 19 will spread it to an average of around three people who will go on to do the same until the healthcare system is saturated and the death rate goes through the roof or until it kills half the people in a nursing home.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ngoni,t2_86rj0,The modelers were incredibly wrong for H1N1 and also for SARS. They grossly overestimated the number of deaths. Every model for this outbreak has been off by 4x 10x. We are basing our public policy decisions not on science but educated guesses with bad track records. Just as people are skeptical of any treatments or cures they should also be skeptical of worst case scenarios that haven't been predictive. Edit I do have to give them a small amount of credit for including their uncertainty in that White House briefing. But if you look at how enormous that shaded area is you can see how much of a SWAG the model really is. I would give them more credit if they included a historical view of prediction and actuals.

But as it stands currently the disease burden right now has extremely damaging potential given how early of a stage we are in at this time. My point was only that for those who criticize the current solution there is added credibility when one can actually propose a viable alternative. Anyone can complain that the economy is really suffering and I agree its a pretty tough situation on so many fronts. But alternative solutions are fairly limited leading me to conclude that we should continue with widespread social distancing at present until we can find an alternative.

On top of it they have no evidence yet if it can be caught again once you get over it.

They can just stay at home for however long the pandemic lasts right Except that if everyone that feels invincible is out there it won't go down for a very long time. In a country with social safety networks or maybe with an UBI they might be able to not go to work and still survive. They'll have to go out once they get evicted for not being able to pay rent. They'll starve. As it is you're telling them to choose their poison. They need to work. But let's say they don't Are you suggesting they do photosynthesis They will have to buy groceries. If they are asmathic diabetic or whatever that causes them to be at risk they'll have to buy medicines if they can afford them in the first place even assuming they have a job And so on. Everyone else is propagating the virus like crazy. The cashiers will likely have it it will be on the groceries the tons of idiots hoarding toilet paper can also spread it etcetera. Even if the particularly vulnerable quit their jobs and shop every 15 days with an otherwise uncontrolled spread they will still be exposed a lot. Your actions would still kill plenty of these people. Btw obviously the virus kills more people that have risk factors than those who don't It's no ebola but it's not a flu either. In South Korea the country that handled this the best way possible tested a lot traced cases and avoided the collapse of the healthcare system so they have almost the lowest mortality rate possible the death rate for those aged 30 39 is way higher than that of the flu in the US in every age group except for 65 years. At the very least twice and that's on the 50 64 range Now apply that to an oversaturated healthcare system and you get Spain or Italy where thousands of people have died even though they implemented lockdowns weeks ago. There have been cases in Spain of a few police officers that died with no known previous illness including one that was 37 years old. But let's assume that you're as inmune as you think to the virus though if you're a man and you smoke that's already technically 2 risk factors. Let's hope at least you're fit What do you think is going to happen if you have a car accident while the ICUs are collapsed and the doctors and nurses completely overworked plenty of them even ill with COVID 19 Just don't drive a car right Merkel said that if they didn't take any measures 70 of the German population would get infected. With a 3. 4 mortality rate that's 2. 38 of the population. Is that a necessary sacrifice for you In the US that would be almost 8 million deaths just from the virus let alone those that are indirectly caused by it. Besides around 20 of cases require hospitalization. Do you think everything will be fine with that many people unable to work and scrambling to put them somewhere because you won't have enough beds That's just psycopathic and incredibly selfish. I'm 19 years old I don't smoke I'm not asmathic or diabetic and have no conditions and I'm staying the fuck home. Because I do care if my actions end up killing tens of people directly. I bet if this virus thrived against people of your characteristics you would be begging people to respect the quarantine. Just like everyone that were part of the Democratic Hoax train until someone close to them died.

The only contained population that was tested was on a cruise ship of older people. There the death rate was lt 1 If you extrapolate those results to the US population the death rate could be between 05 less than the regular flu and 5 So knowing the virulence of this flu currently would indicate that the best decision is to not close everything and collapse the economy for something that is potentially less dangerous than the flu.

No once wages become competitive again and the owners realize you can t pay people minimum wages to slave away in a field surprise Americans will pour in. In Phoenix for example a guy I know owns a construction company and has paid Mexicans for 10 years to do 75 of his work for pay that no American will do. Well it s gotten harder for him recently and he complains about Americans not wanting to work all the time until you realize he wants to pay people 10 12 dollars an hour. Most America will not work construction in Phoenix for less than 18 22 depending on what they do because otherwise fuck just work somewhere with no responsibility and get paid 12 16. This Americans don t want to do this or that while importing cheap labor is what is driving down wages.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Rightquercusalba,t2_9yy1tfm,No in a free market 3M would be able to jack up their prices to U.S retailers and those retailers would be able to buy their products and increase their prices accordingly. They could then use the influx of additional profits to scale up production or purchases to respond to increased competition from other manufacturers and sellers entering the market chasing those higher prices. The free market would allocate masks to the people who need it the most instead price gouging laws make it illegal for retailers across the country to drastically increase the prices of in demand products such as face masks soap bleach and hand sanitizer. kare11.com There isn't a law in MN outlawing price gouging yet cease and desist orders are being sent to retailer such as Menards for increasing prices.

You can't have grills and fire pits on an apartment balcony. Your statistical chance of dying from most of those things is probably pretty low. But this is an emergency not based solely on the percentage of people dying but on the number of people becoming seriously ill and our healthcare systems' ability to take care of those people. You can't simply say well I am comfortable risking my life because you could be a walking death sentence to someone else. And at this point your numbers are incomplete and meaningless. We don't know how many people died prior to testing we don't accurately know the statistics from China and we ultimately don't know how this will all play out. What's the threshold for you How many people have to die or become horriblly sick before you think the states should do something Having people stay home in the short term allows us to get ahead of the disease and make preparations for future waves.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,TheBatBulge,t2_2fjla6vc,There has been a lot of misinformation and lack of nuance. In an ongoing pandemic with a novel not seen before virus it takes awhile to figure out IFR Infection Fatality Rate and CFR Case Fatality Rate These numbers are going to change but they become more certain over time. One of the big sources of differing numbers though is what measures are used in response. There are estimates at the high end for no action taken to lower estimate numbers based on all measures taken stay at home order quarantine testing masks social distancing Further timing is crucial. Covid 19 infection rate is exponential NOT linear therefore mistakes measures not taken soon enough made early in the pandemic have a much more significant impact. Also the timing of when to lift restrictions i.e lifting them at Easter would have been suicidal is important. Who to listen to then Dr Fauci gt Models had showed that the US death toll could be at least 100 000 with aggressive social distancing White House experts said earlier and as high as 2. 2 million without them. cnn.com Another expert that can be trusted MT Osterholm projections i.imgur.com Medscape has a good Covid 19 research and information Center medscape.com

Or in the rare case were your body over heats beyond what it intended amp x200B mycarpe.com mycarpe.com amp x200B gt Once a person s body initiates the fever process chemical messengers called pyrogens are released into the bloodstream. Pyrogens are part of the immune system response and through a complex chemical process cause a person s body to raise in temperature. Once a person has a fever they will often exhibit symptoms like headache malaise anorexia and other sickness behaviours. A person with a fever will also experience heat generating mechanisms like skin vasoconstriction which leads to chills and goosebumps muscle contractions shivering and a desire to be warm. Once a person s temperature reaches its new high setpoint and a fever runs its course the body lowers its setpoint and begins to employ body cooling processes. Due to the fact that sweating is the body s primary way to cool itself down people who are recovering from a fever often experience sweating as a part of that process. It is the body s natural way of cooling itself down and regaining its normal homeostasis. 2 Heres you mayo clinc link btw which i know why you didnt link amp x200B mayoclinic.org mayoclinic.org amp x200B Depending on what's causing your fever additional fever signs and symptoms may include amp x200B Its not a symptom of every fever only under certain circumstances do you sweat and primarily once you cool down as well. amp x200B Stop trying to make excuses for this obvious lie.

Unfortunately businesses take every opportunity they can to cut costs and labor is a big one which is why rules have to be in place to protect people. I 100 agree with your 3rd paragraph and its one of my biggest issues with the kind of bootstrap language we see coming from the right. Big business has captured the government they have figured out how to privatize the gains screwing over regular citizens and migrant workers while socializing their losses and demonizing the poor workers and whatever other scapegoat they can find. I hope this pandemic will at least result in workers receiving more protections better wages and the dignity to live their lives freely. Markets are intended to work for everyone maybe we will start seeing that in our lifetime.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,seanpeery,t2_y1a1l,Seeing as we could possibly lose more lives from this crisis than the civil war or at the very least a comparable number of lives it probably should have been declared weeks ago when flights to China were stopped. America should have gone full isolationist mode with strict quarantines and reporting. Then we could have kept our cases in the hundreds less than a million people would have lost their jobs and the economy would have barely been touched. Now because of a failure of leadership to act quickly and consistently ie shutting down flights to china but not flights to countries that still allowed flights to china we are faced with hundreds of thousands of deaths as a best case scenario and what they aren't telling you on the news is that the crisis for America won't end until next Spring regardless of what happens.

That's what I mean by perspective. If people only compare it to the flu yeah it's bad. If they compare it to various other things there's a wider perspective. Handy char in this article telegraph.co.uk In yet other comments you still seem to have missed the point of my post and would rather argue against something that wasn't present. gt Just because you aren't seeing the level of death you could be seeing without these shelter in place orders does not mean the orders are doing nothing.

Are you immunocompromised kinda like my mom or old or severely asthmatic and don't want to risk getting it You stay home. Order your groceries online find someone you trust to be clean go get them for you go get them yourself while wearing a mask homemade or otherwise It's not much different than what you're already doing. Let the rest of us who are healthy or apparently so go about our lives and run our businesses. It's not essential until it's your place that goes under. That's kinda my two cents on it.

Of course it is San Francisco and who really cares about Nancy's home town My thinking We don't want any rights suspended. But we are willing to let it happen in a situation like this.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,calculatedfantasy,t2_1383fc,Interesting suggestion and would like to hear more. What about the extremely high volume of those individuals considered high risk groups that live with among the general population. How do we effectively isolate distance them. Unless you suggest that everyone over 65 live in a separate building town from the rest of the world. The virus sits very effectively in asymptomatic carriers and spreads just as easily i m not sure how I could possibly practice social distancing in a home where you may share a bathroom food and general amenities with my grandparents. Not antagonizing just hoping to better understand the nature of your solution. My understanding is that citizens going back to work en masse will no doubt spread the virus more rampantly which I hope we agree on that point. Subsequent to that the high risk groups we inevitably live with among are in turn at a much higher risk of contracting the virus. I agree if there was some mechanism of isolating all people over 65 in aggregate within a bubble distanced from the world that this may theoretically work. But i m not sure how to achieve that.

Yet that didn t happen. Quarantining is humanities response to discovering a widespread deadly illness. That s what always happens during a pandemic. Take a look at history. It most certainly does have the right to suspend elements of the constitution. Look up marshal law. Hence why it s doing exactly that. In every single natural disaster war or crisis the government has suspended rights of citizens in favor of the collective.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Mechasteel,t2_12zjwp,Correct. The authority was already given to the government before the crisis. Quarantine and disease are things we already planned for. gt The federal government derives its authority for isolation and quarantine from the Commerce Clause of the U.S Constitution. gt Under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act 42 U.S Code 264 the U.S Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to take measures to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States and between states. gt The authority for carrying out these functions on a daily basis has been delegated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC gt Under 42 Code of Federal Regulations parts 70 and 71 CDC is authorized to detain medically examine and release persons arriving into the United States and traveling between states who are suspected of carrying these communicable diseases. gt States have police power functions to protect the health safety and welfare of persons within their borders. To control the spread of disease within their borders states have laws to enforce the use of isolation and quarantine. gt These laws can vary from state to state and can be specific or broad. In some states local health authorities implement state law. In most states breaking a quarantine order is a criminal misdemeanor.

They turnout no matter what whether its a general or mid terms. The turnout benefit would substantially help the dems more even if GOP turnout benefits from this.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,dc2ac,t2_1bvyokkz,gt Those children wouldn't be here without the illegal alien parents. That is a valid analysis. It even subtracts the estimated amount of taxes illegal aliens pay. It's incredibly exhaustive. True they wouldn t be here without their parents but the report is still false if it claims that fiscal burden is being caused by illegals when it s literally caused by citizens. Not to mention we have no data breaking down whether or not the children were born while the parents may have been here legally. Remember that a lot of illegal immigrants just end up staying once their status expires. Not everyone is sneaking across the boarder. The study also shoehorned everyone who s status is currently up in the air or who have been given exceptions. The authors seem to go out of their way to increase their numbers. gt Edit There's a very valid criticism of jus soli citizenship that was simply deemed valid by government apparatchiks not by any law or court decision despite the explicit discussions around the 14th amendment by those that wrote it. That s a different argument I honestly don t know enough to argue either way but what we re discussing is the ramifications of illegals. The way things are now those children are 100 legal and thus entitled to those benefits costs. I can understand disagreeing with it but that s our current reality.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,caesarfecit,t2_aaip0,I'm getting deeply skeptical over almost everything people are saying about this bug even the federal government. Nobody seems to be blood testing the population to find out how many people have already been exposed try and pin down the timeline and how much further it has to go. People keep saying that if we lift the lockdown too soon we risk a second spike but if we don't know population exposure rates rather than just confirmed cases we're shooting in the dark. I've seen YT videos of people going into New York hospitals and they're empty. Talking to paramedics and they're saying they see maybe 3 cases in a day and even then they're not sure. The people who die seem to invariably either the old and sick or people pre made for media cherry picking. What if this is just like every other pandemic scare where the virus is mostly harmless unless you're already sick What if most of the population has already been exposed to the virus and didn't even develop symptoms What if all this lockdown bullshit is politically motivated and driven by fake news and a cycle of hysteria Notice how the only people really buying into this stuff are people who watch the fake news and those people repeat the talking points almost robotically and call out people on social media Everyone else is going along to get along and waiting for this to end. Notice how it's only been a few weeks and the economic cost is becoming clear while the human cost is looking horribly exaggerated It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if people started calling bullshit on this whole thing very very soon. The very things we need to know are the things nobody seems very interested in and yet are totally possible for us to find out.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,17037,t2_8dzce,Not to be rude but you miss much of the problem with Trump promoting these medications. All medications need to follow a path of testing and retesting. For any politician to go on the news and hype up a medications potential aid is not done to aid people... It's done to brand the medication with the politicians ego. By all means these promising drugs needed to be moved to the top 20 for immediate testing and retesting... but jumping that step is criminal. Those drugs are used for other illnesses at present and have supply stocks at levels for those conditions. Jumping in large numbers on the limited supplies directly takes those medications away from the people who doctors know for a fact need them. Second is supply chains. Once testing does narrow in on the right medication and right dosages there then needs to be enough produced to be able to meet a demand at this level. People screaming for a rare drug with limited production does not help anyone. There are medical ways to go about this entire process. It's awesome these drugs are showing results. That does not make Trump going on tv and talking them up before needed steps were taken was OK. It was a petty ego move.

But I do not want nonsense imposed on me because THEY can't have any self responsibility. THIS is the difference between a conservative and a leftist. I don't care what they do. They can sit by their windows eating take out burger after burger while looking for fucking unicorns. Conservatives just want to be left alone. The current impositions especially in some states are lunacy. Time to all grow up put on big boy pants and make your own decisions.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,fredemu,t2_73h4p,Alyssa Milano is the actress that basically started the entire MeToo thing and was a constant pundit during the whole Kavanaugh trial and a person that the Democrats decided to put on full display in the audience the entire time due to her work at getting that whole thing to go viral. She was outspoken that we have to believe women that we should investigate claims thoroughly and that we should call into question the character of men who would even be accused looking at things so trivial as social calendars their completely typical levels of love for alcohol and high school antics to paint a backdrop upon which to judge the unproven and un provable claims. A few days ago she posted a twitter thread twitter.com strongly supporting Biden and urging Bernie supporters to do the same. She has never even mentioned his accuser. If you need more proof of double standards and Democrat privilege I have no hope for you.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Skyebits,t2_mlhs9la,Trump should probably answer why he cut the pandemic unit. We can do this all day.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Doctor-Jan-Itor,t2_4y0h0h99,Because the claim is that they said they needed more ventilators but the money was spent on an illegal Ed program. That s the claim that s false.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,RedScorpion08,t2_edn65,Except that this is more deadly than the flu. It's much more contagious than the flu. You can get it without the carrier showing symptoms. NY hospitals are nearly over run. If my rural state doesn't take measures soon each small town could be a breeding ground for future waves. Just because you aren't seeing the level of death you could be seeing without these shelter in place orders does not mean the orders are doing nothing. There is a point to slowing the spread but we can't do it indefinitely our economy can't take it.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,nbrownus,t2_eowtx,You might want to reevaluate Trumps love of other dictators his actions and the base that wants to see America become a trump dynasty. Edit twitter.com lang en
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,DoorGunnerYoda,t2_5a3uq4h1,Trump has a rambling off the cuff way of speaking. It's refreshing because he's more transparent than past administrations but unfortunately it makes it easier for the media to take his words out of context.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,americazindabad,t2_jp2crl3,Turnout is still going to be higher than 2016 huge drop off that year in the dem base as mentioned in the article but yes this coronavirus all things equal benefits the GOP because their base is more likely to turnout in spite of this virus threat. I am hoping McConnell is not forced to give in to her demands for vote by mail. That will benefit the dems a lot.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Doctor-Jan-Itor,t2_4y0h0h99,While they should have made the recommendation tax dollars are not fungible for things like this. Each department had their own budget. They can t just say well we allocated funds for this program but we now need it here so gimme. That s not how government budgets work. At least they didn t before the health crisis. They could probably get away with moving money around now but taking funding from one program as stupid as it was to pay for preparatory measures wouldn t happen.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Diche_Bach,t2_lvs5i,This is TRUE Which is why we MUST BE RELENTLESS IN REPEATING THE MESSAGE gt That party needs to be thoroughly punished this fall pass it on. The party needs to either reform so that is agenda is not dependent on the destruction of America or splinter off a new party. If you vote Democrat until one of these reformations occur you are in fact acting to further forces which seek to destroy the United States of America in sum a TRAITOR. In sum do something or accept the outcome.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ultimis,t2_5xpfs,It's not really protectionism the international produce markets aren't exactly free market. Victor D. Hansen talks to this where family farms were turned into corporate illegal immigrant plantations over a generation due to other countries rigging their agricultural output. Effectively the U.S allowed unfair market practices abroad to kill the traditional farm in the United States.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Grimakis,t2_n7pjs,Disagree. The thing about food is there are many types. In economics there is a concept of a substitute goods. We already know that fruits and vegetables are expensive and low income people don t eat many of them. If we increase the cost of labor farmers will need to increase the cost of produce. Some people will pay the higher price and others will simply find something else to eat. In reality what I would expect is the market for produce to simply shrink to a new equilibrium point. Is that bad Not necessarily. However I don t think this can be viewed as taking American jobs.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,SwampMidget,t2_qsm8,President Trumps approval ratings are rising sharply. This is precisely why networks like NPR and MSNBC are now refusing to air the President's update.

Having some passing familiarity with the Navy's communications system I can tell you if it leaked he probably leaked it because the only channels this would be appropriate information to communicate on would be up the chain on a secure system. Information that might give our enemies a leg up on understanding a potential weakness in our military readiness is not something to pass around lightly. Maybe if there was broad malfeasance by command and people were dying rapidly AND there was no legitimate military reason to accept those casualties MAYBE you could justify going public morally although it takes a lot of morally' to overcome the UCMJ

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,optionhome,t2_jn1y7,gt Well for starters...an estimated 160 million people are either overweight or obese.

One day she says to me you know fox does have bias but they're probably the least out there. I can't believe how ABC is reporting on this and the reporter's questions are so stupid. All at once it was like a switch had been flipped btw this started first with the whole Kavanagh thing.

A lot more people wouldn't mind martial law if it were an Ebola outbreak. The issue is one where people's outlook depends on their perspective where needs of others may or may not outweigh the needs of the individual.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ETHNJCB,t2_zhja4,I m sorry you re getting downvoted. This isn t r the donald and I d like to think the people here are a little more civil. You re not wrong about the fact that this shouldn t be a partisan issue. I had the privilege of interviewing Dr Jonathan Ringo the president of Sinai Hospital in Baltimore Maryland. He s an entrepreneur as well as an MD and he said if the drastic measures that we have taken hadn t been taken there would be bodies lining the streets in NY. The point this meme is trying to make is slightly missing the point but the core idea of liberty still stands. You re correct we shouldn t be going out and id like to think we re smart enough to not go out on our own accord. But some purple have their heads up their asses and don t understand public safety. This shouldn t be a partisan issue but people choose to make it one. In times of crisis we have to be flexible with our circumstances. Have a wonderful weekend and stay safe.

The work is also only for a few months so how can people find stable work People arent lazy they just arent getting enough to make it sustainable so desperate people like foreign workers are the only people who will do these jobs and that is how the industry is setup. Raise wages protect workers and maybe you'll see more people interested in this kind of work.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,TallDad1,t2_gy4hsbz,I wonder if they realize that by caring about what he says they then empower his words rather than detract from their power.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,FlyingElbowPasta,t2_48oq2va6,The state does not have the right to disarm your basic rights of freedom of press religion gun ownership etc. in times or crisis. However they can make you not assemble in groups over 10 as we see today. Our country s formation was heavily influenced by James Locke s freedom of life liberty and property. He says that the reason why government was created was to protect those three rights. In contemporary times such as the Corona Virus a person assembling with more than 10 people or going to non essential places infringes other people s rights of life because that person is increasing the chance of spreading the disease. In this case the government can institute temporary laws to protect the lives of citizens. The government quarantining us is for our own good so that we may live. Very extreme Democrats today do not have the real right to implement major changes to society that fit their viewpoint because of just Corona Virus Also I think that OP doesn t mean that he can go outside without being restricted. I don t think he is trying to seem harmful

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,TheCorporateKnight,t2_1xmedma,Based on how Florida's Unemployment system is working and I imagine many other states as well this is beyond an inconvenience.

This is creating a powder keg.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,fretit,t2_jy2wf,gt If the virus was already in the US and around the world how would a ban on China specifically stop it It was in much high concentration in China at the time compared to the rest of the world. Having a few cases somewhere does not justify adding many more. The highest incidence of the disease was clearly in China at the time so it made sense to restrict flights from China. When the number of sick rose in Europe a ban was put in place for those Europe as well but somehow no one cried racism then. gt but I'm saying her statement is about how she thinks Trump is unnecessarily creating racial issues through the Chinese travel ban People can always see racism anywhere when they are set on seeing it. The travel ban was necessary. The ban was extended to Europe soon after when it was clear there was an outbreak there as well. A ban was also put in place for Canada. Why aren't those ones not called out as unnecessary or racist but the China travel restriction is automatically racist This has become the problem with democrats insistence that everything is motivated by racism and various other nefarious reasons when common sense can explain it. The democrats are convinced that Trump and his supporters are racists supremacists crooks idiots etc. So they see and interpret everything they do through that lens. Travel restrictions on China He did it because of racism not because it was the F in epicenter of the outbreak. And this extends to every single thing he does and it is constant. They always latch on to the most nefarious explanation for everything he does. I see that as paranoia and prejudice and I am sick and tired of it.

Think of it this way......Fast Food places are unhealthy especially if you frequent them a lot. And we both know that there are many obese people that are always there. And I don't even mean people who surpass some BMI index. I mean huge people. Why are they there Because they are stupid and don't even realize that they are practicing a slow form of suicide. Well how about we CLOSE all fast food places until the FAT people stop going to them. That is inflicting nonsense on the majority because of those too fucking stupid to live their own lives responsibly. And remember that those obese people are burdening the healthcare system since they have a myriad of obesity related health issues. So if you are medically comprised and you go out to a restaurant and get the virus which nudges you over the cliff and speeds up you imminent demise....too bad. It was your choice.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ed_merckx,t2_6qtz2,gt But the minute a person is arrested for having a BBQ with a neighbor or a pastor is arrested for exercising his first amendment right to freedom of religion the government has gone too far. Banning religious gatherings would almost certainly be unconstitutional and the minute a state tried to enforce that with force the courts would step in. From every church I've seen mine included they made the voluntary church to suspend services and try to do some form of pre recorded seminars or virtual connection with the congregation. Hobby lobby already sounds like they have a court case going about not being allowed to operate questioning the definition of what an essential service is. For example why is a golf course considered essential but a hobby shop isn't I expect we will see many court cases if this thing drags on. Adjusting zoning or occupancy rules making changes to liquor or night club license that are well within the legal framework is one thing but indefinite shutdowns of not only private business but movement of people for a very broad public health crisis will be challenged especially when as I mentioned other businesses are allowed to operate.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,tritonice,t2_3sb88,Here is what I saw Current solider is on guard duty Sergeant or chief of detail comes out and announces changing of guard sets wreaths etc. New guard emerges from side entrance and makes his way to chief for inspection. Chief conducts inspection. We could not exactly tell what failed but it was something on his uniform buttons or shoulder epaulets. New guard returns to barracks out of sight to remedy problem New guard returns to center for re inspection. I think he failed again if memory serves. New NEW guard backup emerges and is inspected. He passes and the changing officially happens. During this whole time maybe 10 minutes old guard never stops his 21 steps. I guess he would have stayed on duty until an acceptable relief was available. I would love to know how often inspection actually fails and if there are any ramifications to the solider who failed. It was surreal to watch especially knowing how dedicated these soldiers are to this duty one of the most sought after from what I've read I'm sure the guy who failed was embarrassed and humiliated although he shouldn't be.

Though 50 increase is an example even a 100 wage 20 increase would hardly increase your grocery bill. Tax revenue would increase due to higher wages and localities would benefit property values would increase in these small towns.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,CherryCokeNixon,t2_dgcu8,Scumbag fact checker claims that there's no relationship between funding college for illegal aliens and not funding more ventilators. Yet money is fungible and priorities need to be made. New York has been quite clear that its priorities have been aid for illegal aliens and abortion on demand for the past half decade. This sleazy article also lets Cuomo off the hook by squealing that although the state of New York's report found the need to have 18 000 more ventilators it never recommended that the state purchase more. Oh okay.

Citizens are suffering through an event that they have little control over the government needs to help them through that. There is not a way to help the economy through a pandemic other than supporting the working people. You don t have an economy without workers and you definitely lose workers if you don t take a virus seriously. This country has survived many things. If you start trying to sacrifice people s lives to save the economy you ve got the wrong priorities. The economy is here because of the people not the other way around.

Presidents get blamed for economic slowdowns it just happens and the Democrats know it better than anyone.

Some things are consistent regardless of the time such as liberty. The core concepts of liberty are the exact same today as then though people such as yourself are far too willing to give it over to daddy government. I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of presentism. Presentism is dismissing any and everything because they held some different beliefs even though much of what they held is still valid today. It is another form of prejudice leftists love to practice against those who lived in different times. Dismiss everything because of few flawed beliefs commonly held in society at the time instead of taking a nuanced approach.

Who cares about what the law says now There have been many evil laws throughout history and this is no different. gt It is NOT clearly evil that is why it s a debatable question. I said that it's clearly evil if you accept the premise that human life lies in its essence rather than its function. Most people implicitly accept this premise but deny the conclusion because they haven't logically thought through the issue. If the pro choice mindset is taken to its logical conclusions then you arrive at where Peter Singer is where killing newborns and infants is perfectly moral. gt What it definitely is not is a scientific fact that we ought to give rights to non persons. I never argued that any should question is scientific in nature it's obviously a moral question. But once again you're asserting your position i.e fetuses aren't persons without any arguments besides an appeal to the current legal standard. Frankly it's very unconvincing.

Trump downplayed the whole thing calling it a hoax and bragging that he's got it all under control and Biden just mindlessly attacking Trump. The ideal president would have seen the high infection rates in other countries and would realise this this is not a hoax and that he should start limiting people going in from countries. Not to mention Trump got rid of the pandemic team which I hope we can all agree was a crappy move.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ngoni,t2_86rj0,For the past decade the federal government has been nurturing a group of about 50 epidemiologists and math modelers at universities. The U.S government launched the effort when it became apparent that U.S expertise in disease modeling was outstripped by England s world class experts said Dylan George a former Obama administration official at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy who was involved in that effort. Since January the CDC has been working with that larger group of modeling teams but it has been unclear especially in recent weeks how much the White House was listening to their data and projections. The handful of projections the task force has plucked from the group and used in White House discussions administration officials said are sometimes deployed with an audience of one in mind Trump. Officials have said the Imperial College s eye popping 2. 2 million death projection convinced Trump to stop dismissing the outbreak and take it more seriously. Similarly officials said the new projection of 100 000 to 240 000 deaths is what convinced Trump to extend restrictions for 30 days and abandon his push to reopen parts of the country by Easter which many health experts believe could have worsened the outbreak. But what remains unclear and alarming to many modelers is whether the White House is using their data to create a coordinated coherent long term strategy. Such a national strategy is critical because of the lag time in data that comes with outbreaks. Any numbers we see today confirmed cases hospitalizations and deaths lag two to three weeks behind how the virus is spreading. So decisions made by authorities based on that present day data are almost by definition reactive and potentially come too late. To get ahead of a virus like this one authorities must use projections of the future to act in the present. A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to speak by name said the administration does have long term plans and has been addressing those concerns in the daily briefings. Repurposing a car plant to make ventilators is great but honestly I m not one to cast stones but it could have been done earlier said Shaman the Columbia University epidemiologist whose models have been reviewed by the White House. But Shaman doesn t think the White House s death projection is too low nor does he think it s too late to act decisively. I think we can come in under 100 000 deaths. I do he said. The jury is not yet in on this.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ngoni,t2_86rj0,Leading disease forecasters whose research the White House used to conclude 100 000 to 240 000 people will die nationwide from the coronavirus were mystified when they saw the administration s projection this week. The experts said they don t challenge the numbers validity but that they don t know how the White House arrived at them. White House officials have refused to explain how they generated the figure a death toll bigger than the United States suffered in the Vietnam War or the 9 11 terrorist attacks. They have not provided the underlying data so others can assess its reliability or provided long term strategies to lower that death count. Some of President Trump s top advisers have expressed doubts about the estimate according to three White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. There have been fierce debates inside the White House about its accuracy. At a task force meeting this week according to two officials with direct knowledge of it Anthony S. Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told others there are too many variables at play in the pandemic to make the models reliable I ve looked at all the models. I ve spent a lot of time on the models. They don t tell you anything. You can t really rely upon models. Robert Redfield director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the vice president s office have similarly voiced doubts about the projections accuracy the three officials said. Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access. Jeffrey Shaman a Columbia University epidemiologist whose models were cited by the White House said his own work on the pandemic doesn t go far enough into the future to make predictions akin to the White House fatality forecast. We don t have a sense of what s going on in the here and now and we don t know what people will do in the future he said. We don t know if the virus is seasonal as well. The estimate appeared to be a rushed affair said Marc Lipsitch a leading epidemiologist and director of Harvard University s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. They contacted us I think on a Tuesday a week ago and asked for answers and feedback by Thursday basically 24 hours he said. My initial response was we can t do it that fast. But we ended up providing them some numbers responding to very specific scenarios. Other experts noted that the White House didn t even explain the time period the death estimate supposedly captures just the coming few months or the year plus it will take to deploy a vaccine. Almost the entirety of what the public knows about the death projection was presented on a single slide at a briefing Tuesday from the White House coronavirus task force. A White House representative said the task force has not publicly released the models it drew from out of respect for the confidentiality of the modelers many of whom approached the White House unsolicited and simply want to continue their work without publicity. A representative for Fauci did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Vice President Pence declined to comment. On a Thursday call with conservative leaders Pence said it was difficult to view the models but the president thought it was important to share with the American people. Among epidemiologists the estimate raised more questions than it answered not just about methodology and accuracy but perhaps more importantly about purpose. The primary goal of such models amid an outbreak is to allow authorities to game out scenarios foresee challenges and create a coherent long term strategy something some experts worry doesn t exist within the White House. I wish there were more of a concerted national plan. I wish it had started a month and a half ago maybe two months ago Shaman said. Natalie Dean a biostatistician who was not involved in the White House effort but is working on coronavirus vaccine evaluation with the World Health Organization pointed out that the whole reason you create models is to help you make decisions. But you have to actually act on those projections and answers. Otherwise the models are useless. At Tuesday s briefing Trump unveiled the government s projected death count saying it was based on data that has been I think brilliantly put together. The coordinator of Trump s coronavirus task force Deborah Birx then projected a slide with a high arcing mountain showing the worst case scenario 1. 5 million to 2. 2 million deaths if Americans and the government did absolutely nothing to stop the virus. And a smaller but still imposing hill with 100 000 to 240 000 deaths if measures such as social distancing are taken. Birx said the projection was based on five or six modelers including from Imperial College in Britain and Harvard Columbia and Northeastern universities. It was their models that created the ability to see what these mitigations could do how steeply they could depress the curve Birx said. But two models appeared to have been particularly influential the one by Imperial College and one from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington IHME At a news briefing Sunday Birx explained the process this way Her task force initially reviewed the work of 12 models. Then we went back to the drawing board over the last week or two and worked from the ground up utilizing actual reporting of cases Birx said. It s the way we built the HIV model the TB model the malaria model. And when we finished the other group that was working in parallel which we didn t know about referring to the IHME group. The IHME model initially estimated deaths through this summer would total 38 000 to 162 000 a lower projection than many others and beneath the White House s own estimate. But because of its lower figure and Birx s comments experts believe it to be a main source for the White House s best case scenario of 100 000 to 240 000 deaths. Meanwhile the White House appeared to rely on Imperial College for its worst case scenario. That study estimated as many as 2. 2 million U.S deaths if no action was taken 1. 1 million deaths if moderate mitigation strategies were adopted and an unspecified number if drastic measures were taken. But as a common mathematician s refrain goes A model is only as good as the assumptions it is built on. Knowing the assumptions built into the White House officials projected number could tell us a lot exactly how contagious and deadly they believe the virus to be. It also would reflect their beliefs on how the federal government and states will behave in coming months and whether they will do enough to make a difference. The IHME model assumes every state will quickly impose stay at home orders which some states including Alabama and Missouri have yet to do. It also assumes the entire country will maintain these restrictions until summer. But Trump has extended the White House s restrictions until only April 30 and made clear he wants to reopen the country as soon as possible. Another key question is what time period the White House s 100 000 to 240 000 projection covers. Imperial College s worst case scenario calculated the toll exacted by the virus over a couple of years. But if the White House s projection covers only the next few months like the IHME model does the true death toll will almost certainly be larger because the United States will probably see additional waves of covid 19 until a vaccine is deployed. And it is important to note experts say that the IHME model differs from many epidemiological models another reason its death estimate may be lower experts say. Epidemiological projections are often based on what is called the Susceptible Infectious Recovered model SIR It is a mathematical way to represent three different populations in an outbreak those vulnerable to infection those who are infectious and those gradually removed from the equation by death or recovery. IHME however took an entirely different approach. It is a statistical model that takes the trending curve of deaths from China for example and fits that curve to emerging death data from cities and counties to predict what might come next. It s a valuable tool providing updated state by state projections but it is inherently optimistic because it assumes that all states respond as swiftly as China said Dean a biostatistician at University of Florida. In an interview earlier this week the head of the IHME group Christopher Murray said his model was created for a different purpose from Imperial College s. The reason we created our model is to help hospitals plan. How many beds you ll need how many ventilators when the peak is likely coming Murray said. The purpose of Imperial s model is to make people realize government intervention is crucial and what would happen without that. continued

See where I m going here The Constitution makes it clear that there is to be no official religion in the country and yet to this day all three branches continue to base legislative judicial and executive decisions on Christian beliefs. You don t have to agree it s simply my opinion that it s time to stop mixing religious guidance in with public address.

But what about all those who are bragging about still going to parties and coughing on stuff in supermarkets These laws aren't made to suppress your rights any more than laws against other crimes. If going out to foolish and unnecessary events presents a real danger to others then it infringes on other peoples' rights which is in many ways a basis for many of the laws that we live with every day. It's like following traffic laws. Do you get mad at the government for telling you how fast to drive Or do you appreciate getting to work in one piece every day I appreciate not getting sick and not losing my family members to a horrible respiratory illness so I want my government to tell those selfish fools to stay inside or punish them if they don't Not forever of course there should be an end tentatively planned.

I want people to stay at home but I don't want the government to use force to take away people's rights. gt so that the people we love and even people we may not know don't die unnecessarily This would be a good outcome but it's happening anyway even in countries where the government is literally arresting everyone who leaves their homes. Also this argument can be applied to literally anything that causes death. gt I can't tell those idiot spring breakers to stay home Sure you can. Lots of people have. gt but the government sure as shit can Not under the constitution they don't but I'm sure you'd rather have temporary safety than actual liberty. gt you're damn right I want it to That's obvious. gt I love my parents.

It s like how in the state of TN where marijuana is illegal you can go get tax stamps and put your name on a nice govt list for all of your illegal pot plants so that you can pay your taxes on them.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Opiumbrella33,t2_3ijfyw7,Really My grandfather was removed from his parents and given to a white family as a child but he was full blood umpqua national. I have always been removed from that part of my heritage because my grandpa was taken away. I could get money monthly from the tribe but I don't take it because I feel like it would be wrong. But I am starting to learn about my heritage and culture which is amazing. And the tribe has been SO welcoming. They are actively seeking out people with blood ties even small ones and bringing them into the fold. I'm sorry you have not had the same experience. I know it is a hard thing for many as mixed white native children started out often as the product of rape or slavery forced marriage. Their full blooded children were often removed and out in group homes or given to white families like my papa and many were killed at the hands of these people. There is a LOT of historical trauma and that can make some members of tribes more unwelcoming to outsiders. Not saying it is right wrong just saying some of the things that likely contributed to their behaviors

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,0siris0,t2_bd7qe,Flu hospitalization rate is about 1 COVID is 20 I disappointed that my side of the political aisle is revealing ignorance about basic statistics. It's not the fixed numbers that matter because numbers are an outcome of variables as they work over time. Yes at any given moment X say the middle of March the flu which had a six month head start on the population with a mortality rate of 1 Once COVID starts it's killing with a rate of about 1 in the middle of March point X it will be behind the flu in death numbers. But in a month or two by points Y and Z not only does it surpass the flu but skyrocket past it. The reason why COVID mortality would only be 1 is because of the draining hospitalization rate that takes up limited hospital resources to save lives in the process crowding out hospital beds for cancer patients heart attacks broken limbs and the normal amount of health problems that happen at any given moment that can't be treated because a new disease drags 1 out of every 5 people into the hospital to live unlike 1 out of every 100 with the flu. If only 1 out of every 100 COVID patients went to the hospital instead of 20 the kill rate of COVID would be 5 10 a 50 100 times kill rate of the flu. By the end COVID will have killed 10 times the amount of Americans as the flu has and hospitalized 20 times the amount of Americans as the flu has. That is the threat and why the President sees past this weird cognitive dissonance in r conservative to deny COVID. He sees the ratio and not the number creating the false equivalence of flu hospitalizes hundreds of thousands COVID maybe a little more but we don't shut down the economy for the flu which is an equivocation fallacy based on the large difference in mortality rates hospitalization rates and recovery requirements.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Rusty_knuckle,t2_bn3yjdm,Of course hes exaggerating. I feel pretty normal doesn't make ratings. I remember on 9 11 there was a journalist on one of the cable news networks who was right near the towers when they collapsed. She was in the studio when I first saw her and she had a bit of dust on her clothes. Not a huge amount but a little anyway. This person was interviewed off and on all day as we all tried to grasp what was happening. Never once did she ever have the appearance of trying to brush the dust off change clothes anything. This despite plenty of opportunity to do so. I dunno about you but my natural reaction is to brush myself off and it was strange to my 15 year old self how it appeared deliberate to preserve that look. That day started my questioning of journalism and its snowballed ever since.

Personally I am in the camp that estimates around 30M based on historical trends. I know many claim 11M to 12M and somehow claim the total number is decreasing year over year do they think we are that stupid But ICE detained 850M people attempting to cross the US Mexico border illegally last year cbp.gov What percent do you think they catch I think half is generous. That means 850M new illegal immigrants entered. Also odd how the wikipedia article graphs stop in 2016. lol they really do think we are that stupid.

Because many migrants are stuck in their home countries and visa offices are closed there is a terrible shortage of labor for the upcoming berry cucumber and squash harvests. These farmers are BEGGING for domestic workers and have been doing so for years. This is the same in parts of Canada California and Michigan's fruit belt.

We used to just sign the title and we were done but Mexicans would buy the car and never transfer the title because they would have to pay taxes or they would drive it straight to Mexico sometimes taking toll roads and the owner of the car would have to pay all the tolls.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Allah_the_Lights,t2_ir74r,Also it seems to that there are two sides to this coronavirus issue. A liberal side and a conservative side. One side is advocating for scientists and experts taking charge and leading the way. Which has been working I live in WA state and we are doing much better than NYC because we had early action and a lot of the tech companies told all their employees to work from home early on like in the beginning of March Early February. That had the effect of shutting down the Seattle economy since so many jobs are reliant on other tech workers who are now working from home. This helped mitigate the spread of the virus in the area. Also the universities were developing their own tests but were shut down by the CDC since they weren t directed by the CDC. The other side is advocating to still go to church and was calling for re opening of the economy last week. Which side do you think is correct with how their response is Not trying to be a douchebag liberal talking down on republicans just look at the facts without bias and decide for yourself who is right.

So while he didn't literally say it's the wonder drug that's going to beat coronavirus he may as well have.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,BarrettBuckeye,t2_goc9j,Well obviously farmers are essential. Maybe I'm reading between the lines a little too much here but I don't really think that's the question you're asking because the answer is obvious farmers make the food that we need so of course they're essential. What I think you're trying to ask is since you mentioned illegal aliens is do we think that the illegal aliens working on these farms are essential. For the time being they probably are simply because they're not going away tomorrow and we're in the middle of a viral pandemic this means that they wouldn't be so easily replaced in the immediate future. So I guess the answer to that question is yes too. However it's not essential to have illegal aliens working on these farms as a general solution in the long term. What I find a little ironic from the left is that they'll simultaneously make the argument that we need a 15 hour minimum wage because people need to be able to afford to live while also making the claim that we need to allow illegal immigrants working jobs like these to stay. What are illegal immigrants not good enough to earn a decent living Why do we accept unlivable wages for illegal immigrants They have families and bills too. That's not even the worst of it so now in addition to pricing people out of the job market due to the fact that their labor isn't worth the amount that employers would be required to pay under minimum wage laws you create a scenario where you bring in a bunch of people who you don't have to pay as much. You've left employers with no choice but to hire illegal labor in these cases. They've screwed everyone from people here legally who could have negotiated a wage from farmers to the farmers themselves for having to hire illegal labor in order to keep labor costs low enough to keep the price of their goods in a reasonable range to the illegal worker themselves for being the only option in a black labor market in order to get work. What kind of workers' rights and protections do you think they'll have In the here and now yes. They're essential due to a peculiar circumstance. In the long term farmers are obviously still essential but illegal labor is not especially if you look to reform restrictive laws with regards to hiring legal labor.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Obamasamerica420,t2_1kiroxl2,What went wrong Well we can start with the Democrats interfering with every single action the President has taken during the last 3 years but specifically these past few months. Impeachment took over our Government from November through February. It was a partisan effort that accomplished nothing but waste everyone's time. This idea that well Trump should have ignored us trying to remove him from office is fucking ridiculous. After impeachment failed did the Dems and the media turn their attention to the Coronavirus No but Trump and his team did. And how did the Dems respond They pushed back against things like the travel bans that actually ended up saving our asses. It was termed a distraction. The only thing we heard about during February after impeachment was the Dem primary. Debate after debate. Continued attacks on the president. Not a peep about Coronavirus. It wasn't until early March that anyone outside of Trump started taking this seriously in America. And then suddenly the Dems are upset that Trump didn't bypass congress and start taking dictatorial control of the country....aka the things they were trying to impeach him for a month before. Adam Schiff is directly responsible for delaying any Coronavirus response. Nancy Pelosi is directly responsible. Nadler Schumer all of them fiddled while the virus snuck in. The Democrats have control over the house and the media and they did nothing but point fingers. The Democrats failed our country.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,I_am_just_saying,t2_73i36,Its interesting that their hospitalizations predictions are significantly higher than the reality well outside the 95 UI but that they have slightly increased their prediction on total deaths in their model. A few speculative reasons why this MAY be the case... The number of actual hospitalizations reported across the US is drastically wrong Their model is more than 10 days off the timeline but the general curve will still be correct Their model has a major deviation from the current established relationship between hospitalization and deaths Their model has some other major flaw and is compounding that error in deaths as a result of their hospitalization numbers being wrong and they have not corrected for it

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,scholarandrogue,t2_c9kkf,i agree. there is already the welfare state and the army of NGO's and bureaucrats and politicians and of course some banks manage some programs. these people number in the millions. they would gladly welcome anyone into the trap. people will be competing with illegals and guest workers for jobs in a 50 percent unemployment economy. all the while contending with grifters drifters and thugs. furthermore when they leave home there will be a higher probability of burglary since some jurisdictions do not prosecute property damage or theft or robbery. expect a parabolic increasing trend in criminal behavior post quarantine. i expect it will be messy. there will be culture clash between rule of law with property rights and socialism. hopefully progressive leaning unemployed will see the counter culture created by progressive values legislation and policy but universal basic income will be appealing to people who are not future oriented thinkers.

The humor is extremely subtle and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook which is deftly woven into his characterisation his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature for instance. The fans understand this stuff they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes to realize that they're not just funny they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots of course they wouldn't appreciate for instance the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Foubar,t2_tpsej,Sweden is following the original British strategy the one Boris Johnson was planning to implement before the Imperial College s model of the contagion convinced him that up to 500 000 people might die if the country didn t start following aggressive social distancing measures. Initially Johnson s plan was to encourage older and ailing Brits to quarantine themselves as thoroughly as possible while the younger healthier part of the population went on more or less as usual. Infection would spread rapidly many would get sick to various degrees and some would die but at the end of this relatively quick mega storm of disease the country would have acquired something like herd immunity. Then the old and infirm could reemerge. Sweden s infection and death rates are accelerating faster than other nations That s the point They re not really trying to flatten the curve. They re going to get this over with as quickly as possible whatever that means for Swedish hospitals over the next month. Sweden s also expecting its unemployment rate to rise this year despite its willingness to remain open for business although only from seven to nine percent. Whether you like the strategy may depend on how you feel about raw numbers. Assuming a case fatality rate of 0. 2 percent infecting every last person in Sweden s population of 10 million should produce some 20 000 deaths. That s a big number in the abstract but it ll be dwarfed by death tolls around the world. Maybe Sweden feels it can absorb 20 000 deaths in the interest of avoiding economic ruin. But they re gambling a lot on that fatality rate. If the rate is more like one percent then suddenly they re staring at 100 000 dead the equivalent of three million in the United States. That s a big number for a small country.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,PhilosoGuido,t2_ahtk1,Hydroxychloroquine has been around for decades. It has been tested and well tolerated. It is even given preemptively to travelers to malaria regions to prevent malaria. At worst it may do nothing to help this disease but it's not some random chemical cooked up in the lab overnight that might kill tons of people. Doctors are very familiar with this drug's side effects and contraindications. gt Also if there wasn't time for any studies then why not just release all the current candidate vaccines to the general public Vaccines are completely different. These are a new compound. It's a false analogy to try and compare a brand new vaccine to a drug that's been used for over half a century for a wide range of diseases. Furthermore there have already been some studies on Hydroxychloroquine it's just that the naysayers are to bitch that the studies weren't large enough weren't randomized double blind etc. All the things that take months or years to accomplish. But my point is they couldn't care less that none of this has been done for any of the other random antiviral drugs being experimentally used. The only difference is that Trump didn't say anything about those drugs so they don't get politicized. gt And yeah I know the opposing argument is that suicide rates would spike due to a depression but I haven't seen any articles or people quoting actual sources. It's just a bunch of people taking Trump's word for it You don't have to take Trump's word for it. You can use your own common sense. You'd have to be a fool to believe people will not die due to the economic effects The simple act of moving up everyone's schedule up an hour each spring with the pointless Daylight Savings Time causes a 24 increase in acute heart attacks openheart.bmj.com more strokes aan.com increase in suicides car crashes healthline.com Drowsy driving is similar to driving under the influence and work accidents. A prolonged economic shutdown with millions of people losing their jobs or businesses is bound to cause untold number of deaths already that we may never fully realize. Furthermore we have no idea what the true fatality rate of this disease is. The numbers keep getting revised down. The initial number of 3. 4 was utter bullshit. The latest estimate is now 0. 66 thelancet.com 20 30243 7 fulltext It may still be much lower than that. We don't know what the rate of mild or asymptomatic cases are because those people aren't being tested at all. One report where they tested an entire town of 3000 in Italy showed 90 of the population infected but 50 75 were asymptomatic. So the fatality rates may be much lower. If it turns out that this is not much worse than the flu that kills up to 90 000 a year then this level of shutdown very well may end up killing more people than the disease itself. Therefore it is absolutely the President's responsibility and concern to balance the effects. It would be dereliction of his duty otherwise.

It also does not report the massive tax burden of illegals which amounts to a low end of 54 billion per year per apnews.com or 135 billion per year at the high end per fairus.org In either case the fiscal burden is far higher than their supposed tax contribution.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,CorneredSponge,t2_re0gnzq,Temporary means as long as this pandemic lasts and then some time. The stimulus bill can be called socialist the Trump administration cannot be called socialist. The stimulus bill is a redistribution of capital by the government. On the other hand an administration cannot be said to be socialist based on an emergency aid bill. A deficit doesn't matter if it contributes to productivity See Modern Monetary Theory and is within a manageable range. 5 10 Debt isn't a good indicator of economy Venezuela only had a debt 23 of its GDP and it's economy has been in turmoil for a long time. Similarly Belgium has a GDP of around 500B and a debt of 1. 2tn yet nothing happened to them. I'm not particularly sure about what you meant to say in your last question but I assume you meant that I as a capitalist by flair actually a Free Market Corporatist would be mad about this stimulus bill However it is I'm not opposed to a degree of democratic socialism. I'm in support of M4A with a private option and such. And I'm also in support of a UBI as it's beneficial to every type of economy with monetization.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,cfinboston,t2_wzea9,I'm not sure it's a partisan issue. I think it's more about leadership. Inarguably Ohio's Mike Dewine has been amongst the best in the nation. I've seen him praised by hardcore progressives. Florida and Georgia's governors have been embarrassments. CA Governor Newsome has praised President Trump and RI Democratic Governor Gina Raimondo has told the ACLU to kick rocks while arresting a bunch of jerk offs from MA who crossed state lines to play golf. I think the state that's going to get a lot of attention is New Jersey. It's a terrible perfect storm of abutting two major urban centers of Philadelphia and NYC. Its taxes are amongst the highest in the nation and its overburdened public employees pension system is going to collapse. Governor Murphy was amongst the last governors to allow a delay of State Income tax payments. There are several sanctuary cities and Murphy has hedged on shutting down construction. The Democratic controlled Legislature will enjoy going on a tax raising spree while constituents realize the only people left with jobs are government employees.

Johnson s party is definitely a step back in the right direction though. Another issue is that we don t have a balance of TV media the way the US does. Something as simple as having Fox News provide an alternate view on current events isn t something we have in the UK all of the news channels are differing shades of left. That has an obvious effect on the culture when they all can t help pushing intersectional bullshit at every opportunity.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,diluzionalmind,t2_1c3069my,Convicted felon here. Your assessment is completely correct. I understand that most people want to take advantage of a system the would benefit them more. Which is why I try not to get upset with the people taking those advantages but clearly the system is to blame for making it even an option for felons or illegal immigrants or just immigrants to get privileges that law abiding natural citizens don't have. Many democrats want to make sure people like myself get the right to vote even while incarcerated want to have much more lenient punishments for the crimes being committed and have even worked towards making pedophiles which even most of the other prison population hates and wants to hurt kill into a protected population. Yes you read that correctly. While in prison in Minnesota I learned it is a hate crime to assult one of the pedophiles and that they even are placed into protective units if they feel threatened. Now as a felon it might make sense if I wanted more advantages for me to vote democratically. I am a conservative though. I broke the damn law and there is punishment and personal responsibility to be observed no if ands or buts about it. I believe in reforming inmates which you sure as hell can't do if you tell them everything is society's fault like the democrats have been touting for years. I'm sure the ego centric sociopaths won't find a way to incorporate that into their violent ideologies at all. I apologize for the long rant there this is something that bothers me a lot.

Liberals cried screamed jumped up and down said that the government's not doing enough we aren't testing enough people we need to be doing more so we ramped up testing once the infrastructure got in place and now we're testing more than anyone else and our numbers go up... well obviously they're going to. We have a much higher population than other countries in Europe that are running near the same number of tests we are so of course we're going to have higher overall numbers but if you look at the mortality rate in our country versus the other countries we have some of the lowest numbers in the world. And that doesn't take into account the people who are positive that haven't yet been tested if your numbers are doubling overnight which they were a couple weeks ago then you expect four time that number to be positive that aren't tested. That's putting the overall mortality rate at about 0. 5 to 0. 6 in the U.S with that being in the case you can look at a country like Italy with a mortality rate of 10 That's 20 times the actual mortality rate of this virus that means they're 100 000 cases is about 20 times lower than what it should be because they aren't running the test that they should be. so you can jump up and down and scream that we have the most cases in the world but it simply isn't the case.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,otakuon,t2_14ljzj,What plans would those be from the Democrats The areas getting hit the hardest are the ones run by the Democrats. The Democrats were the ones back in January and February telling everyone not to worry and use the subways and go to the lunar New Years and Mardi Gras celebrations while this virus was out there spreading like wildfire. Meanwhile we have the Governor of California a Democrat obviously saying this is a prime opportunity to usher in a progressive era and you have Democrats in Congress that are trying to delay the relief efforts in order to load them up with Lefty pipe dreams that have nothing to do with combating this disease or helping people make it through this period of economic disarray which will have a far greater impact on all of us than the virus itself will ever have. Meanwhile the President shut down travel from China back in January has been having daily briefings authorized wartime style production orders and the response from the Democrats and the media was to just use the same old and tired labels of he s racist stupid evil all the while acting as China s propaganda machine here in the US.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Airick39,t2_4budi5h0,Under control is not an either or state. How much virus is out there will determine our course of action. Realistically this virus will be with us for awhile. Years probably. It s not the type to burn itself out. Assuming that 2 months of stay at home flattens the curve significantly and we have pumped out PPE and respirators for hospitals you would allow businesses to reopen and urge at risk people to continue to self isolate. Schools will already be closed but you have to let kids go to camp and baseball and the pool. You have to have your summertime economy.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,cfinboston,t2_wzea9,The problem is it's not going to be over for a long time. Old ways of thinking aren't going to work anymore. Abigail Shrier whom I typically love wrote a tone deaf tweet about how this is going to bring about socialism because people will get used to being lazy and getting paid to do nothing. She misses the fact that many unemployed folks would be more than happy to swallow their pride and apply at Starbucks except they're closed. If every out of work hairdresser bartender and Uber driver went and applied for the jobs at Wegman's and Stop and Shop there wouldn't be enough jobs. The next wave of layoffs is already happening local newspapers are cutting staff as are tech companies. For the left they may now see looting. In the face of genuinely scarce resources maybe they'll take a second look at who's getting funds. If you're frantically checking your mailbox for your stimulus check and bemoaning that the Unemployment Office has a frozen website just maybe you'll take a second look at your neighbors who are filling their shopping carts courtesy of SNAP. And G d help them when their nana is refused a ventilator in favor of an illegal.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Ch33mazrer,t2_3xgewq6i,I don t want to sound inhumane this crisis is horrific and barring any benefit I wish it had never happened however Trump has a distinct advantage here because he s a leader in a time of crisis. If the crisis is still going on in November a lot of swing voters will look for steady leadership and that won t come from a transition of power. If it s not then Trump can say he helped save the country which itself is great optics.

They may have been calling him xenophobic and were more preoccupied with trying to impeach him. Ventilators will be rolled out as needed. It's absolutely insane one city would think they are entitled to 2 3 of the ENTIRE Federal stockpile. Limited resources need to be spread around. But the hubris of Coumo and NYC shouldn't surprise anyone. The only reason we have the most OFFICIAL cases is because we've done the most testing. This is impacting everyone around the world and If you believe the numbers coming out of china are accurate and actually lower than ours then I have a ship to sell you.

I would understand if they were making something that may have a bit more liability or scrutiny but hand sanitizer Really That s just got Obama written all over it. That s the kind of little stupid crap that a former presidents cronies would pull. But trying to blame every little thing on Trump is just getting old. However it s just going to get worse the closer it gets to November. I wonder when suicide weekend is for all of the Obama cronies I m sure when they realize that things are about to go from bad to worse they would rather die than face the music.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,sakko13,t2_4qxzg3lg,Your country wasn't the first affected. It isn't by far the poorest. It isn't the biggest. And yet is has the highest numbers. Why Maybe because ur government didn't take it serious in the beginning Maybe because Trump said it would be gone in April like a miracle just to stop the downrating of the stock market Maybe because your government didn't use the WHO tests in the beginning Maybe because Trump dismissed the team to fight a pandemic two years ago and lost something about a month to respond the threat And when he is asked about these facts he calls it nasty or blames Obama for the heritage of bad tests when in reality there couldn't have been tests at these times. Also he tweeted in 2014 that Obama should retreat because of 2 Ebola deaths and 14 infected but now he would see it as a good job if there would only die 100000.

And by health conditions yes heart disease is included which HALF of Americans have. If you add in diabetes asthma CRD and cancer we are looking at a good 65 of our population. If we all went back to work and let this very easily transmittable virus spread that could mean a death toll of 9 of around 200 million Americans.

He's doing that CA bullet train to nowhere that's billions into the hole among other shady things.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Waffelschrank,t2_5s3i534g,I even pointed out that it's not all conservatives I differentiated for a reason. Some do for a matter of fact however because conservatism exists on a spectrum. You decided to ignore that truth in order to play the victim. gt This is what happens when you have education without the ability to think for yourself My critical thinking skills tell me that people using only insults and no arguments aren't in the position to talk about education. Unfortunately we're in this echochamber where I don't have to expect more than that.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,lyintedscrews,t2_wvoqg,Note people defending Feinstein but not Loeffler even though they both claim to have a blind trust. They need to send better shills.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Samuel_Sokotas,t2_5e600pr4,It's more of a memorial to all soldiers who went MIA and were never found presumed dead. So people who cannot receive a proper burial.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,LiVeRPoOlDOnTDiVE,t2_20dfa2r4,To be fair some countries have done a little to stand up to China.. for instance Chinese people have been blasting Denmark on their social media because a newspaper published a modified version of China's flag https jyllands posten.dk pictures image 11898346 wdqprq ALTERNATES h 5 3 ledersidetegning mandag 27 01 20 rgb and the Prime Minister refused to apologize to China for the flag. They also have a Pillar of Shame statue hongkongfp.com that voice support for the Hong Kong protestors outside the parliament which they're refusing to remove. There are plenty of small gestures like this throughout Europe.. But I do agree that they're doing way too little and I sincerely hope EU also start a trade war with China support Taiwan independence do something to defend Hong Kong Xinjiang and Tibet start calling it the Wuhan Virus or the China Chinese Virus and ban Chinese companies such as Huawei from their markets.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,lyintedscrews,t2_wvoqg,I think at this point MSM and the CCP are pretty much on lockstep.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,ThePopcornTape,t2_zqr82,Honest question Why do we still guard the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier if it's empty The last remains in there were identified years ago then given proper burials. Was the memorial repurposed I don't mean any disrespect to the fallen whatsoever and I apologize if this is coming off as such.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,obliviononahalfshell,t2_jdw0t,Trump Fuck yeah

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Otto-Carpenter,t2_2dvn6rtd,Bullshit. When the story broke people called out Loeffler Burr Inhofe and Feinstein. Burr s case appears to be the most egregious but Loeffler should be held to account as well. I won t hold my breath for Feinstein.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,TimMakesThings,t2_5w9s8uwz,Wow I'm so glad my tax dollars are spent on military soldiers defending long buried corpses... How fiscally responsible And clearly an essential service
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,Waffelschrank,t2_5s3i534g,gt Where's this burgeoning right wing religious ethnostate and its army of advocates Certainly not in this community. Congratulations on claiming you could speak for every individual in this community of several thousand regular users. That's a very smart move that will very likely convince more people than the reactionary circlejerk here. Of course your argument is bullshit. You can't speak for everyone here and you don't know everyone here. Playing the victim though Check. The truth is the homogenous ethnostate is something an extreme fringe group would support. They do exist for a matter of fact on the far right political spectrum and in this community because they share a lot of the very same rethoric you use. But I pointed out the exclusionary nationalism for a reason because that one is widespread here and it's only a precursor for the ethnostate.
Conservative,t5_2qh6p,koozy407,t2_2z95vo9z,This is dangerous. My 37 year old brother is in the hospital with covid along side his wife. He is in KY where he had to work security for churches that refused to close he s a police officer no preexisting condition just a previously healthy couple fighting for their life and we aren t allowed to see them. I hope you don t have a similar story in the next couple of weeks.

Conservative,t5_2qh6p,MrDrPatrick2You,t2_2uex5g22,Don't know why you are getting down voted for asking a question. I believe once DNA became a thing we identified the original unknown soldier. But now this a memorial to those who serve our country and fall in the line of duty who's actions and name are known only to God.
