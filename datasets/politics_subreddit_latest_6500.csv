He started by openly making disgusting remarks, (calling minorities criminals and joking around about ""grabbing her by the pussy).  But fine, freedom of speech, even if it is fucked.  He proceeded to ""drain the swamp"" by instilling the most corruption we have ever fucking seen in our nation's history.  

He literally said, """"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and *shoot somebody*, okay, and I wouldn't lose any voters, okay?""  And you know what, he's 100% right.  He has proven that he can absolutely shit on whoever or whatever he wants, and he'll be backed no matter what.

He went through *years* of incompetency, but it was still fine by a lot of people.  And now, when a legitimate crisis hits, he absolutely shits the bed.  He spent the time we could have been proactively preparing for it by undercutting its severity and calling it a fucking hoax.  Once he realized it wasn't, he tried to cover up the numbers, literally insisting that a cruise ship doesn't dock because he liked the numbers.  He proceeded to finally accept it was a legitimate problem, when it was far too late, and then lied and patted himself on the back for ""acting as quickly as possible.""  Once he realized that wasn't favorable, he started blatantly lying about opening up by easter (once again undercutting the severity of all of this), then worked on a stimulus bill that he himself isn't abiding by.  

And we are overreacting for thinking he's a fucking shit stain of a president that's quickly fucking over this country?  It doesn't take anyone of even average intelligence to realize what a fucking moron and danger he is to democracy, let alone a political scientist.

As for my previous point, the environment they used was totally different than real life conditions. They sprayed the virus containing aerosol into a Goldberg drum, which is a sealed environment with no air flow. As I pointed out, literally any building with any ventilation will disperse the particles. In the study, they used an environment where the virus could not be dispersed. You see the problem there?

Based on recent polling, she now has no chance against Collins, so Kemp essentially made the choice for no gain, because apparently no Republican can be trusted (I've only heard of one case of a Democrat's *Husband* trading on COVID related stocks, but she was in the process of telling everyone the sky was falling, so it's a little different (though I still thing members of the House, Senate, and Cabinet, should be required to have any holdings and stock in bling trusts, but that's a different issue)."

This dumb idiot and his equally dumb family members are leading the U. S . down a path to disaster.

As a leader, Donald Trump is incapable of leading a troop of girl guides on a cookie drive around your local neighboured but he has been thrust into the role of leading the nation through its worst crisis since 1861. His incompetence and ineptness has become immediately obvious. He is reduced to making ridiculous claims, rewriting history, contradicting his own recorded statements and blaming everyone else for his own inabilities and shortcomings!

They then spin what amounts to taking legal bribes from the insurance industry as a ""moderate"" position(lmao what?) and make dubious claims that they would lose purple states if they didn't take insurance industry bribes as if the average voter is pro-bribery and would be insulted if their elected officials didn't take insurance industry bribes.

1)  If there is any position in the Executive Branch that should not be able to be fired without cause, it's the IGs.  I disagree with firing someone like Comey, but there is something to be said for the President needing to be able to trust and work with his advisers.  The fact that Trump values loyalty over competence doesn't really change this when considering future administrations.  However, given that the job of the IG is oversight, the President having the ability, without recourse, to terminate their employment without cause other than ""losing confidence,"" undermines the whole point of oversight.  I know that at the end of the day it probably wouldn't go anywhere, but I hope Atkinson tries to sue him for wrongful termination.  There's always the possibility that he could get a judge that would at least allow discovery, which could be ""interesting"" in it's own right.

Well, here it is April 2020 and he still supports Trump, even though the man (if you can even call Trump that, boy or child is more apt) has demonstrably shown his contempt of the IRS and attempts to evade being held accountable for his tax returns.

Earlier this week I asked him if he still supports Trump even after his mismanagement of the coronavirus response. Sure enough, my dad still supports Trump because ""80,000 people die of the flu each year and nobody cares.""

I get what you're saying - but Trump absolutely can't win. If we let him win then it will prove to him that he will never have to worry about repercussions. He will be completely unrestrained without fear of political or legal consequences. 

So you're feeling defeated. Ok. Let's look at this - Trump won in 2016 because Dems didn't show up..That's frustrating. But just look at what has happened since - the Dems won some truly shocking special elections. They did amazingly well in the midterms. Turnout is up and opposition to Trump is high. 

The only way we lose is when we don't show up. Theres no reason to succumb to defeatism. Trump won once - but once isn't a pattern. If we let him win again *then* it becomes a commentary us. But if we flood the polls and truly kick his ass then his original election was just a fluke. A stroke of bad luck brought on by just the right mixture of over confidence and apathy.

Half the time the original author got way too cute with what is essentially near-legal language. Someone who has a tighter grip on exposure asses the language and cleans it up for reality. Why? Because should party X fail to keep the promises made by historical party Y, they are subject to whatever the blowback is, but aren't culpable for the language.

Sure, its absolute shit timing, but not everything is a nefarious scheme. Now, considering the other nefarious schemes that blowback is earned, but in this case...after reviewing the language, I'm about 95% certain.

I hate trump but I like americans. if trump is taking actions that potentially save american lives, then I have to acknowledge it. these are products manufactured in america by an american company so, as far as I'm aware, he's legally allowed to seize shipments so long as the govt pays market price for it.

""but then canada will just stop selling us raw resources"", people keep saying. and then what, spend 6 months building manufacturing facilities? or are they going to sell to china [who has also seized medical product](https://www.dailysabah.com/world/americas/us-snatches-60m-france-bound-medical-masks-from-tarmac-in-china)."

Our government is build as a ""good faith"" institution.  It assumes the people elected and hired are competent and ethical, and there are no automatic or legal pathways to counter abuse of this good faith.  It needs to be remarkably easy to remove a politician, not incredibly hard to near impossible.  Trump is INSANE, but there has been no political nor (amazingly) lawful action taken against him.  He is not losing his job despite a criminal history and ongoing criminal cases against him.  He is not losing his job despite a history of unethical behavior and active unethical behavior.  His is not losing his job despite being entirely incompetent, unprofessional, and is causing direct harm to the public by willful ignorance or willful evil.  He is not losing his job despite abusing good position for monetary gains, favors, and leveraging his status to receive them.  He is not losing his job despite lying, quite literally thousands of times to everyone about literally everything.  If he's talking, he's lying.

It's not really Trump though.  It's the entire Republican party.  Trump was their golden ticket.  They want him to stay.  He is the useful idiot.  He is their tool to bypass the executive branch and attack the courts.  He is their key to turn a 3 branch government into 1, and by one I mean a singular Republican entity acting more as a mob, as an oligarchy.  Trump is the key that allows this and maintains this.  Their at Willy Wonka's chocolate factory reeking havok, and they fucking LOVE that golden ticket.

Even though this is one giant con, one giant sham, you see no law agencies of any sort doing anything.  No police, no lawyers, no FBI, no class action suits, not a damn thing.  Even the impeachment was a pile of shit and repeats to show that this whole thing demands good faith, because there's nothing in place to protect the people or the institution."

&gt; 
&gt; When President Trump battled impeachment early this year, his reelection campaign staff blasted out Facebook ads, texts and emails to donors and supporters, arguing that he was delivering gonzo job figures and a soaring stock market in the face of bitter partisan obstruction.
&gt; 
&gt; Those ads drew Trump‚Äôs highest audiences on Facebook, his campaign‚Äôs chief advertising platform, which it has used to test out thousands of messages and images since the 2016 election.
&gt; 
&gt; Now with the nation‚Äôs economy reeling, more than 10 million Americans out of work and the stock market plummeting 30%, Trump and his aides are struggling to find a new message he can take to Americans for the November election.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúFive weeks ago, it was all going to be about this amazing economic machine that we had built,‚Äù said Stephen Moore, a former economic advisor to Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign who remains in contact with the White House. ‚ÄúIt seems like 100 years ago.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; So far, at least, Trump‚Äôs campaign has not directly mentioned the COVID-19 pandemic in its Facebook ads. It is test-marketing a handful of ads that only vaguely allude to it, casting Trump as a unifying leader for a ‚Äúnation facing uncharted territory.‚Äù One says Trump is uniquely suited to keep the country ‚ÄúSAFE.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Whether voters agree with that argument, and how they view his competence in battling the coronavirus outbreak and reviving the ravaged economy likely will determine his political fate, overwhelming other judgments about his rocky tenure in office. Polls show he faces widespread concern that he mismanaged the government‚Äôs early response.
&gt; 
&gt; After weeks of downplaying the coronavirus crisis, Trump cast himself as a ‚Äúwartime president‚Äù in mid-March, recommended drastic social distancing measures and signed the country‚Äôs largest-ever stimulus package. During his nightly news conferences, he went from rosy projections of a quick turnaround to grim-faced warnings of 100,000 to 240,000 American deaths and a deep economic recession, if not worse.
&gt; 
&gt; Larry Kudlow, Trump‚Äôs top economic advisor, said Friday that the 10 million jobless claims filed in the last two weeks don‚Äôt fully reflect the economic pain. Kudlow, who had spent weeks suggesting the stock market crash offered investors a chance to buy on the cheap, conceded that hardships will ‚Äúget worse before they get better.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; In response to another bleak jobs report Friday, Trump‚Äôs campaign promised relief for small businesses and workers in the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by Congress, even though the initial rollout of $350 billion in loans for small businesses was mired in confusion and delays.
&gt; 
&gt; It also accused former Vice President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, of ‚Äúuseless partisan sniping from the sidelines.‚Äù Since the crises worsened, Biden has been forced to run his campaign from the basement of his home in Wilmington, Del.
&gt; 
&gt; Biden‚Äôs campaign called Friday‚Äôs job report, which said the economy shed 701,000 jobs in March, sending the unemployment rate to its sharpest one-month rise since 1975, a ‚Äúflashing red light‚Äù and said that Trump needs to push another stimulus package to stop the economic bleeding.
&gt; 
&gt; Other red lights are flashing for Trump‚Äôs campaign, however.
&gt; 
&gt; After embracing national guidelines for social distancing in mid-March, Trump‚Äôs approval ratings for his handling of the crisis began to climb. But a poll released Friday by ABC News and Ipsos showed a decline from 55% three weeks ago to 47%.
&gt; 
&gt; Several governors, especially those who issued stringent stay-at-home orders, saw their poll numbers jump.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúGovernors have been seen as more clear and decisive about their actions, and they‚Äôve gotten a lot of credit,‚Äù said Charles Franklin, who conducts a monthly tracking poll for Marquette University in Wisconsin, a crucial state for Trump‚Äôs reelection campaign. ‚ÄúTrump has been less consistent in his rhetoric about how we should think about the crisis, but the consequences of those actions are less clear.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, wins high marks for his handling of the epidemic from three-quarters of the state‚Äôs voters, for example. Trump‚Äôs handling rates well with just over half of Wisconsin voters, according to Franklin‚Äôs poll.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of that difference may be the result of Trump‚Äôs divisive rhetoric, which has helped the president maintain a solid core of support, but has prevented him from winning over Democrats and independents throughout his presidency.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúAttitudes about the president are deeply ingrained, both positive and negative,‚Äù said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. ‚ÄúSo there is a powerful tendency to view the president‚Äôs performance through the preexisting lens.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Trump has done best in polling when he has spoken realistically about the threat ‚Äî as when he introduced the social-distancing guidelines last month and when he extended them last Monday until April 30, with a painful assessment of the potential death toll.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThe more his briefings are like Sgt. Joe Friday ‚Äî just the facts ‚Äî the stronger he is,‚Äù said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, a reference to the old Dragnet series.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúMy advice is to be realistic ‚Äî to describe things as they are, not as a salesman ‚Äî and the more realistic he is, the more reassuring he can be,‚Äù said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for President George W. Bush. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a problem, point it out in a nonaccusatory manner and explain how you‚Äôre going to fix it.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Trump has done that on rare occasions. But in many tweets and public appearances, he has lashed out at governors for demanding too much and not being ‚Äúappreciative‚Äù enough ‚Äî even as their hospitals and morgues overflow ‚Äî and suggested he might divert resources to those who say nice things about him.
&gt; 
&gt; He has denied responsibility for widespread testing problems, falsely insisting any American who wanted a test could get one. And instead of using his authority to coordinate a unified response, he had told states to solve their own supply problems, leading to a Darwinian fight for test kits, ventilators, masks and other critically needed medical gear.
&gt; 
&gt; Some Republicans believe voters will forgive or forget Trump‚Äôs many statements downplaying the danger, his boasts that infections were under control, and his repeated claims, as recently as a week ago, that COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, was no worse than the flu.
&gt; 
&gt; Both Biden‚Äôs campaign and Priorities USA, the main Democratic super PAC, have launched TV and digital ads in swing states featuring Trump‚Äôs early expressions of nonchalance about the coronavirus.
&gt; 
&gt; Tim Miller, a Republican strategist who worked on former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush‚Äôs failed 2016 presidential campaign and has become a vocal critic of Trump, said Democrats can argue that Trump not only dismissed the danger with his rhetoric, but also failed to act swiftly enough on the information he had.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThe timeline here is critical, because this is such a slow-moving disaster,‚Äù Miller said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this flattening of time with us all stuck in our homes, and people are open to the idea that everyone was caught by surprise and came to it late and that‚Äôs not the case.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; He cited a Feb. 5 tweet from Sen. Christopher Murphy (D-Conn.), who concluded after leaving an administration briefing that Trump‚Äôs team ‚Äúisn‚Äôt taking this seriously enough.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúThere has to be no mistaking the fact that the Trump administration knew this was coming, knew enough to brief the Hill, and yet the president failed to act when it would have really mattered,‚Äù Miller said. ‚ÄúThe Democrats‚Äô challenge is making this as clear as possible, and it‚Äôs a lot harder, politically, than just clouding things up and making it seem like everyone is just as guilty as he is.‚Äù

politics,t5_2cneq,HoverHandily,t2_5mppyw4e,,"&gt;Executive orders expire at the end of an administration, unless signed again by the incoming executive. Most are allowed to expire.

100% incorrect. All EO's require yearly re-authorization, which are published in the National Registry, else the EO expires. Very few are ever allowed to expire, which is why we still have EO's on the books from the Carter administration.

&gt;Exactly 16 years ago Thursday, President Bush signed Proclamation 7463, giving himself sweeping powers to mobilize the military in the days following terrorist attacks that crashed planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a Pennsylvania field. It allowed him to call up National Guard and Reserve troops, hire and fire military officers, and bypass limits on the numbers of generals that could serve.

&gt;Presidents Bush and Obama renewed that emergency each year. And on Wednesday, Trump published a now-routine notice in the Federal Register extending the emergency for the 16th time, explaining simply that ""the terrorist threat continues.""

&gt;Under sequestration, the CDC, which managed the stockpile at the time, [faced](https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2013/fy-2013-sequester-impacts.pdf) a 5% budget cut. In its [2013 budget submission](https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2013/fy-2013-cdc-congressional-justification.pdf), HHS decreased its stockpile funding request from the previous year, asking for $486 million, a cut of nearly $48 million. ‚ÄúThe SNS is a key resource in maintaining public health preparedness and response,‚Äù the administration said. ‚ÄúHowever, the current fiscal climate necessitates scaling back.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;The decrease caught Rehberg‚Äôs attention at a budget hearing to review the request.

And then there's this:

&gt;""Congress did grant extra funding in response to emergencies, but even then, the stockpile was a small-ticket item. ""

politics,t5_2cneq,CrimsonEnigma,t2_o8ln5,,"&gt; How will Bidens place differ significantly from Germany?

Biden wants a public option, where people have the option of buying into a government-run plan, which is funded through a combination of taxes paid by everyone, premiums (monthly payments), and some copays.

Germany is kind of like that...but also kind of the opposite. There, everyone making under a certain threshold *has* to be on a public plan. Unless you make ‚Ç¨60,750 or more a year (or are self-employed), you have to be on this (this is the first major difference from Biden's plan). There are a couple of different plans, which are run by government-affiliated, non-profit companies (this is the second major difference: Biden's would be run by the government itself). Premiums are set by the German government, and are mostly based on salary, funded by equal employee and employer contributions (like Social Security and Medicare in the US). There are copays for things like drugs and hospital stays, but these are well below US averages (e.g., ‚Ç¨10ish/day). Deductibles vary from plan to plan.

The public insurance plans are actually quite comprehensive - they even cover basic dental/vision and most prescription drug costs (minus copays), which even many countries with single-payer systems don't. 

But, let's say you make over ‚Ç¨60,750 a year. Here, you get an option: you can either choose a public plan, or you can go with private insurance. These insurance companies have a set of requirements they have to meet, but by and large work very similarly to healthcare plans in the US: you have varying levels of coverage, better plans cost more, it's cheaper when you're younger but way more expensive as you get older, people with preexisting conditions pay more (or just straight up get refused), etc. Unlike in the US, the plan *isn't* done through your employer; however, as with public insurance, your employer still pays half your premium (if you have one).

For people making over ‚Ç¨60,750, the German program is similar to what Biden is proposing...""similar"" being the operative word. It's worth pointing out that a majority of Germans who can buy private insurance still choose to stick with the public plans. Part of this is due to risk: once you get onto a private plan, it's hard to go back to the public ones, even if your income drops below ‚Ç¨60,750 (this is yet another difference between the German plan and Biden's). Part of this is due to cost (public insurance is usually cheaper, unless you're a young, healthy individual, and even then, you better save for when you get older). Part is due to ease of access (it's a lot easier to just go on one of the public plans than shop around for insurance). And while the level of care might not be quite as good as thee private insurance plans, the public insurance is good enough for the vast majority of people.

There are also additional insurance programs provided by employers, but those pretty much only cover work-related injuries. It's a good way to incentivize employers to keep working conditions safe (so they don't have to pay for medical bills), while also saving the government some money.

I don't actually know of a country off my head that does it like Joe Biden's plan. There's a number of ways different countries have achieved universal healthcare, from single-payer systems to systems with options to systems where the government provides everyone with healthcare but only covers, say, 70% of the costs (usually people in these countries will buy insurance to cover the rest, a bit like Medicare in the US), to...whatever Switzerland does (it's an almost entirely privatized system that still manages to be universal). America going off on its own wouldn't be unusual, since most countries have different variations of the same goal: get everyone covered.

On a personal note, I usually prefer the German model over Biden's plan. Having the insurance provided by heavily-regulated, government-affiliated, non-profit companies keeps costs down without putting peoples coverage at risk. However, I do like how Biden would let anyone who wants to *opt* for private insurance. I don't think that would make a huge difference (remember, even among Germans who can afford to do so, most don't take the private option), but would probably make it go over better with voters (people don't like the government forcing them to do things, and having an option just for the well-off risks alienating the working class). Still, I can understand Germany's reluctance to open it to everyone, considering how expensive it can be, and having more people on the public plans helps protect them from...shall we say...""sabotage"" by nefarious political parties.

but its being highly twisted to fit their agenda, NY wasn the one doing it before. They're twisting it now since Cuomo signed an executive order to confiscate any unused PPE and ventilators instate to redistribute them where needed.

also the entire reason Massachusetts was buying them themselves this way was because trump told them to do so rather then rely on the national stockpile, then turned around and outbid them on orders of PPE to drive up the price. as well as confiscating the ones they do manage to order.

they then give blue states less then 20% of their orders from the national stockpile, and fill 100% of orders from red states that ally with him."

I'm a die hard Bernie supporter man but let's face it. **BIDEN IS NOT AND WILL NEVER DO THIS SHIT THAT TRUMP IS DOING** 

At least with Biden, we can restore democracy and the Republic. With Biden we can prosecute Trump and all his cronies. With Biden this shit NEVER HAPPENS. NEVER.

However, Bernie supporters who say they will not vote for Biden. I can't be with you on that. Biden is kumquat. No doubt about it. But ya know what Biden isnt and will never be? **THIS**.

So I beg of you. Come November, if Bernie can't pull off this victory which I would love to see, you need to get out there and *Vote Blue No Matter Who*. This is the last stand. American Democracy is hanging on by a thread. We can still save this country and restore it but it has to be done on November 2nd. This is America's last hope to hold onto our Democracy. So whether its Bernie (please please please please) or Biden, we all need to band together and remove this tumor from office because if we fail to do so, Trump will have free reign to take over this country.

FEMA is paying/supplying for the **shipping** for these supplies, probably because these businesses can not get things shipped in currently due to the massive disruption in shipping/flights currently. The goods being shipped belong to the businesses, FEMA is not buying them, the US governemnt isn't buying them and then reselling to private companies. Just helping to get them in to the country. They then are sold normally to the highest bidder.

Now why is it bullshit? Because this is obviously only in the best interest of the **businesses,** and not the States/people who need these goods. The federal government is saying the reason why they have the businesses deal with the goods is because they have the distribution chains already set up, which okay, yeah that *kind of* makes sense, except why is the federal government not just buying the supplies from the businesses and having the supplies shipped through the businesses to where they are most needed. After all I'm pretty damn sure the US government is able to be contacted by governors who can clearly lay out what supplies they need.

Instead they are going the cheapest shittiest route, we foot the bill for the shipping for the goods, then states are forced to bid for the necessary equipment. This is only looking out for businesses and not the citizens, the government literally doesn't care if states can't get access to supplies that they need. They're being fucking cheapskates over peoples lives here, all the burden is being placed on the States."

I go to church (religion) to be with people of a like mind and a like faith.  Really, it's a club.  And like any club, not everyone is going to agree with all the rules.  If you don't agree with the rules, if they don't fit with your faith, don't go.  Or switch religions/churches.

I haven't been to church in about four weeks.  If I don't go for another six months, so be it.  I still have my faith.  But if I went to church without faith, I believe I'd be doing it wrong.  Faith comes first.

And if leaving the church and becoming atheist has made you a more moral person, congratulations -- seriously.  I'd stand behind you infinitely more than any money-grubbing, role-playing fake ""pastors"" out there any day of the week."

how [does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans:](https://berniesanders.com/issues/how-does-bernie-pay-his-major-plans/)

* I added the bold becasue Bernie has many people assuming these funding sources will go away

&gt;$47 trillion total 

&gt;Current federal, state and local government spending over the next ten years is projected to total about $30 trillion.

&gt;The revenue options Bernie has proposed total $17.5 Trillion

&gt;$30 trillion  + $17.5 trillion = $47.5 Trillion total 

-----

The source he lists, National Health Expenditure Projections 2018-2027,  says The $30 Trillion is 

* Medicare $10.6 Trillion (No change to FICA means still deficit spending)
 *  $3.7 Trillion is funded by the Medicare Tax.  

 * **$7 Trillion is Income Tax and Medicare Beneficiary Premiums Payments**

* Medicaid $7.7 Trillion
* **current Out of pocket payments $4.8 Trillion**
 * The Out of Pocket Expenses means that the money you pay for a  Co-Pay or Prescription will still be paid in to the Medicare for All Funding System

**$6.8  Trillion is uncertain funding** including 

* other private revenues are $2 Trillion of this Not Federal Spending
  * this is in Charity Funding provide philanthropically. So even though everyone now has Healthcare will these Charities Donate to the hospital or the government still. Can Hospitals accept donations or does it all go to Medicare for central distributions 
  * the money people current donate to places like the Shriners Hospital or St Jude
* workers' compensation insurance premiums, Not Federal Spending
* State general assistance funding, Not Federal Spending
* other state and local programs, and school health. Not Federal Spending
* Indian Health Service,
* maternal and child health, 
* vocational rehabilitation,
* other federal programs,
* Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,

It appears left out of that was Children's Health Insurance Program (Titles XIX and XXI), Department of Defense, and Department of Veterans' Affairs.

The 17.5 Trillion is then 

* 7.5 percent income-based premium paid by employers		$5.2 Trillion
* New Corp Taxes on Previous Nontaxable Expenses		$3.0 Trillion
* Enacting corporate tax reform		$1.0 Trillion
* Establish a Wealth Tax		$500 Billion
* Enacting the For the 99.8% Act		$336Billion 
* 4 percent income-based premium paid by households		$4.0 Trillion
* Make the Personal Income Tax More Progressive		$1.1 Trillion
* Taxing capital gains at the same rates as income from wages		$2.5 Trillion"

&gt;Gov. Charlie Baker said a complicated international plan to purchase over 1 million N95 masks for Massachusetts health care workers and first responders was hatched after a previous order was confiscated in the Port of New York.
Advertisement

&gt;""Around the time that we had our 3 million masks that we had ordered through BJs confiscated in the port of New York, at that point it became pretty clear to us that using what I would describe as sort of a 'traditional approach to this' wasn't going to work,"" Baker said Thursday.

&gt;The governor did not specify the agency responsible for confiscating the masks.

&gt;After losing that initial order, Baker said his administration landed on a cooperative effort involving New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Ambassador Huang Ping, Dr. Jason Li, Gene Hartigan and the state's COVID-19 Command Center.

&gt;The coalition arranged a purchase of the masks in China, which were flown back to Massachusetts Thursday aboard a New England Patriots private plane.

&gt;The supplies were then transported by the National Guard to a stockpile in Marlborough.

(NYT article behind paid wall, so pasting the interesting parts of the article; i save it to pocket and then I can see the whole article) 

The malaria drug hydroxychloroquine helped to speed the recovery of a small number of patients who were mildly ill from the coronavirus, doctors in China reported this week.

Cough, fever and pneumonia went away faster, and the disease seemed less likely to turn severe in people who received hydroxychloroquine than in a comparison group not given the drug. The authors of the report said that the medication was promising, but that more research was needed to clarify how it might work in treating coronavirus disease and to determine the best way to use it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to send a ripple of excitement out through the treating community,‚Äù said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University..\\

 The study was small and limited to patients who were mildly or moderately ill, not severe cases. Like many reports about the coronavirus, [it was posted](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758v1) at medRxiv, an online server for medical articles, before undergoing peer review by other researchers. 

 The earlier reports from France and China drew criticism because they did not include control groups to compare treated versus untreated patients. Researchers called the reports anecdotal, and said the lack of controls made it impossible to determine whether the drugs worked.

I'm not surprised that the top employers are considered essential. I know Mecklenburg (county Charlotte is in) will probably stay the most affected in our state just due to being a dense city, but I have been mostly proud at how our senators and governor has been handling the situation.

We're working on renovating a portion of our University's dorms into a field hospital (since it's located pretty close to one of our main hospitals). And a ton in the community have reached out to try and help fill in the cracks to source protective gear for our nurses. It's a shame that we, the states, are having to depend more on our own people than our unified government and I fear this will further divide our country and create a greater distrust in our Federation. But I'm proud to see how many individuals are offering their services and facilities to save lives.

Never forget, the power of our government comes from us and us alone. It's our responsibility to take care of each other and it's our responsibility to elect those who have our best interests at heart to help lead and guide us. Ask yourself who you think these people should be. Remember this time when November rolls around.

https://www.salon.com/2020/04/03/trump-administration-quietly-guts-covid-19-paid-leave-provision-that-already-excluded-75-of-workers/

&gt;more than 75%¬†of American workers are employed by companies not required to provide them with sick leave during the pandemic

&gt; The Department of Labor issued a temporary rule¬†Wednesday that effectively exempted businesses with fewer than 50 workers from being¬†required¬†to provide 12 weeks of paid leave for workers whose children are suddenly at home from school or child care under the coronavirus stimulus package signed by President Donald Trump.

&gt; Democrats¬†already agreed¬†to exclude workers at large companies with more than 500 employees from being eligible for sick leave during negotiations with Republicans.

&gt; Democrats called out the Labor Department for adding provisions not included in the original bill. The department's guidance allows companies to require workers to provide certification that they needed to take leave and that there needed to be work for the employee in order to be eligible, thus exempting businesses that have been forced to shut down under stay-at-home guidelines.

&gt; Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., sent a letter to Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia accusing his department of issuing guidelines that ""violate congressional intent"" and ""contradict the plain language"" of the bill."

Everybody has the temptation to only pay attention to stuff that validates their own beliefs, it doesn‚Äôt take much personal effort to challenge them. 

I remember that I was in the fourth grade when Kerry ran against Bush. My parents were right leaning at the time(have since come around, thankfully. Very around, they‚Äôre planning on voting for Bernie in our state‚Äôs primary, although we‚Äôre pretty late so it seems like it might be a moot point by then). The fourth grade at my elementary school had a mock election, I ended up with a group ‚Äúrepresenting‚Äù California. We discussed the issues at a fourth grade level and thought Kerry made more sense, because he hadn‚Äôt just gotten us into a war and would help people who needed it instead of people who didn‚Äôt. If a fourth grader can think outside of what they hear at home, so can a full grown adult who watches too much Fox News.

I omitted alcohol because I lump it under 'drugs'. I think of alcohol as not dissimilar to some categories of drugs, just more socially acceptable due to it historically being safer to drink than water. This isn't the 'normal' view of it, I know, hence my feeling the need to explain.

Drugs, as I'm sure you're aware, can be addictive. It is often not as simple as choosing to take it or not - many addictions started through poorly-perscribed painkiller regiments. More to the point, if quitting addiction was as simple as powering through it with your will, then we wouldn't have a drug addiction problem in this country right?

Responding to your medical illness view, what do you say to someone who cannot afford their medication? It can result in a cyclical problem - no medication makes a higher-paying, better-insured job difficult or impossible to acquire, and yet without that better insurance they won't be able to afford the medication. Some state-run low-income health programs can help, but that's dependent on the medication and the state."

A physician is trained to know what has been proven to work but is *not* going to be an expert in cutting edge science.  Not necessarily, anyway.

Some might be, but the MD title does not by itself mean that their opinions carry weight.  If someone says, ""X% of physicians say such-and-such,"" I'll almost never believe it.

Why?  Because if it's some number greater than 5% and less than about 95%, then it's something we're unsure about.  (Less than about 5% means it's quackery pushed by only a few nutjobs, and more than 95% means it's pretty much established knowledge.  Keep in mind that these are not hard numbers; they're just illustrating the point.)

So ""37% of doctors"" means about as much as ""four out of five dentists.""

I said that it wasn't like Clinton won the popular vote with 70% of the votes to show that the vote was closer than InkBlotSam's comment implied. That 70% was arbitrarily chosen and my point doesn't depend on that. It was a close election and the fact that it was that close, despite Trump being an objectively stupid, dishonest, and horrible person, indicates that a significant portion of the American electorate is either complacent with his behaviour or supportive of him. That's a horrifying thought. 

Further, your comment betrays either a misunderstanding of how American president elections work or a movement of the goal posts. Had the popular vote been the metric with which the victor was chosen, both candidates would have campaigned differently by focusing on different areas, etc...  and the results would have undoubtedly changed. Having said that, I do think that the popular vote should be metric to decide the victor in future elections.

Hopefully it's just a knee-jerk statement and you don't actually believe that.  If you do though, much like the people who are backing Trump and his dumb ideas, that extreme way of thinking is harmful to Canadians.  

1) You can't produce the masks without US materials, or you would be already.  [Read one of the many articles on it](https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/brutal-education-inside-the-mad-rush-to-make-masks-to-battle-covid-19) and you'll see that it's more than just pulp.  It's specialized material that the US has factories to make while Canada does not.  Canada has been trying to find their own factories that could produce the material to scale, and they can't.  The other countries with major production of the materials are China, who you won't be buying from, and South Korea, who has an export halt on the material.

2) If Canada decided to get into a trade war with the US, tens of thousands or maybe even millions of innocent people who don't support that trade war would die as collateral damage.  These people are more than just a political idea, they are people with families who may have likely done nothing to support the trade war.  

3) Canada's national economy would not survive a trade embargo with the US on no notice.  Full stop, your economy would collapse.  Canada receives nearly 60% of all their imported goods from the US.  The next closest partner would be the EU who Canadian's import about 8% of their materials from.  The US imports about 13% of our materials from Canada making Canada only our fourth highest import partner, and only 7% ahead of our fifth highest import partner.  While it would be impactful to both economies, it would much more negatively impact the Canadian economy."

&gt;In 2018, the Trump administration rolled back the Affordable Care Act regulations and allowed ""junk plans"" in the market. Some consumers mistakenly think plans with lower monthly costs will be better than no insurance at all, but often the plans aren't much different from going without insurance altogether, the Herald reported.

[What those plans look like:](https://www.inquirer.com/health/consumer/pre-existing-conditions-aca-lawsuit-health-insurance-20191125.html) 

&gt;When his health plan premium shot up to almost $1,000 a month, he‚Äôd gone online to search for a more affordable option. The Golden Rule Insurance plan he found seemed to cover his needs at about $300 a month.

&gt;‚ÄúI remember being tickled to death, getting that,‚Äù LaFrance said.

&gt;Brokers are required to tell their clients when they‚Äôre buying a plan that isn‚Äôt comprehensive health insurance, but crafty sales pitches often gloss over those details. Plans are supposed to detail what they do and don‚Äôt cover in plan documents, though members may not receive this information until they‚Äôve already enrolled. ...

&gt;Even though he had just been diagnosed, heart failure and diabetes, according to his plan, were preexisting conditions. ...

&gt;LaFrance hired a lawyer to help him appeal, arguing that something he didn‚Äôt know about couldn‚Äôt possibly be a preexisting condition.

&gt;He was denied again. ...

&gt;LaFrance‚Äôs plan defined a preexisting condition as one for which a customer received care within 24 months of enrolling in the policy or that caused symptoms that an ‚Äúordinarily prudent‚Äù person would have gotten checked out in the last 12 months, according to the June 2017 denial letter he received. ... ‚ÄúGiven the duration of symptoms and severity, an ordinarily prudent individual would have sought medical care, advice, or treatment,‚Äù the insurer wrote in its denial letter. 

Don't worry, Trump is still working at it.

&gt;Millions more people could one day find themselves in LaFrance‚Äôs position. A lawsuit seeking to overturn the ACA would, among other things, eliminate preexisting condition protections for people who buy individual health plans and weaken protections for the nearly half of people who get insurance through an employer."

politics,t5_2cneq,snapekillseddard,t2_9j7op,,"And how exactly would that be implemented? Does the goverment pay or does the government itself administer vaccines and/or treatment?

If the government is paying, 1) pharmaceutical companies will gouge the price to hell and back, 2) treatment would include ventilators, care, etc., and hospitals will gouge that to hell and back, and 3) due to points 1 and 2, price of this bill massively increase to a point that it will not be feasible and would have been economically more feasible to just pay individuals more.

So why not just give the people the money necessary, directly? Because a vaccine would be too far away and cost is uncertain, meaning there would be no price tag on the bill, which makes the whole thing a non-starter. Since this would be corona-specific, people would have to turn in claims to say that they were billed for how much and for what, and the government simply does not have the logistical and manpower capacity to handle any of that.

The same thing applies to a scenario in which the government administers treatment. Government does not have the facilities to research or produce the vaccines nor does it have the manpower to properly administer treatment.

Now, does this add to the argument that a government run healthcare would be useful? Of course! But we don't have that. We would have to create that from scratch, which would take YEARS to build up, and even then might not be able to handle a NATIONWIDE PANDEMIC response.

No one has anyone by the balls. No one can do anything other than handle a stimulus bill to help those in need RIGHT NOW. Change takes time, no matter how much it's needed (and it is VERY needed). This is not the time, because we have none."

politics,t5_2cneq,zesuszhrist,t2_kd0uqnc,,"There's a lot of bullshit in these comments about how Republicans are evil, satanic, and interested solely in enriching themselves and corporations at the expense of the working class.

You're not wrong. In fact, that is absolutely right. Except the Democrats are just as guilty. In fact, both parties share the same neo-liberal economic platform. Differences in constituencies are mostly cultural. For example, everyone is giving these GOP senators shit for insider trading, but Diane Feinstein of California, a Democrat, was also pulling the same shit and has been her entire career in politics. To say Trump is exceptional or to write off the blue-collar whites who voted for him is wrong, and to then blame Russia for rigging the election is just flat-out bullshit. 

White working class people despise Hillary Clinton because her husband balanced the budget by raising taxes on the middle class and poor.  NAFTA and other trade deals put the nail in the coffin on midwestern prosperity. In 2016, Clinton represented all the decadence and arrogance of the corporate class that outsourced their jobs to sweatshops in China and Mexico. Gee I wonder why they opted for Trump. 

Trump was an outsider. Granted, he was every bit a political cynic as Clinton and a member of the same elitist, corporate class that has been fucking America since FDR, but many blue-collar whites decided to roll the dice on him. Trump promised that he'd restore their lost manufacturing jobs and dignity. He lied, and his presidency has been an unmitigated disaster of epic proportion.

Instead of focusing on his false promises to the American working class, Democrats opted to chase one russian conspiracy after the other. Now, did Russia interfere? Undisputedly. Did that have any significant effect on the outcome of the election? No. As many comments point out, Trump, the populist candidate, ironically lost the popular vote. 

I'm so fucking tired of seeing dems and neo-libs crying Russia. America isn't in this mess because of Russia. We're in this mess because of your stupidass, greedy, and short-sighted economic policy. And what do the dems nominate in order to address half a century of corruption? Joe Biden. 

So you know what canadians? I hope you have learned your lesson with America. So long as a Democrat or a Republican is at the helm, don't trust a single thing we say or do."

You were pefect till you name dropped tech. I mean, would a decision maker normally lean toward technical depth or strategy and leadership?  Of course Jared probably has neither of those but hear me out.  If a CIO was speaking with a group of consultants (experts), and he had differing information, do you think he actually pulled out SAS as you mention and start playing on the keys, or do you think he got that information from his team members?  Why would he ever need to know Python, or R?   His role is to take all the information, question it, concrete it, and make the best decision that aligns with the business goal and executive strategy.

And as someone who has a few years in the corporate data science realm amongst a myriad of other disciplines, mentioning those specific languages seems weird.  If your gonna drop tech, go balls deep.  Might as well hit it with methodology, algorithms, and frameworks.  You ever work a job doing this stuff or just academia?

politics,t5_2cneq,Farscape12Monkeys,t2_2cxoqsbh,,"I was thinking about who would be a good comparison to Trump worldwide and it just dawned on me.

People often compared Trump to other U.S. President such as Hoover, Bush Jr., Harding, Buchanan in term of incompetent and mismanagement.

However, for me, Trump is basically Tsar Nicholas II. When he took power, Nicholas II was completely unprepared, incapable or unwilling to learn, unable to understand why the Russian people wanted reform, and had a stubborn refusal to admit his mistakes until it was too late.

Like Trump, Nicholas II was the absolute wrong individual at the worst moment in history to have held power over such a massive country and people.

In the book, ‚ÄúBlack Night, White Snow‚Äù by Harrison Salisbury about the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917, The Minister of War Alexei Nikolayvich Kuropatkin described the Tsar:

‚ÄúOur Emperor has grandiose plans in his head to seize Manchuria for Russia and to go on from there to unite Korea with Russia. He dreams of putting Tibet under his power. He wants to take Persia and occupy not only the Bosporus but also the Dardanelles. When we ministers hold back the Czar from achieving his dreams he feels in his disappointment all the more certain he is right and that he understands better than we the glory and the good of Russia. That is why the Bezobrazovs, singing in unison, seem to the Czar more understanding of his purposes than we ministers‚Äù.

Here is how Historian Barbara Tuchman described Nichloas II, last Tsar of Russia:

""[The Russian Empire] was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government‚Äîto preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father‚Äîand who, lacking the intellect, energy or training for his job, fell back on personal favorites, whim, simple mulishness, and other devices of the empty-headed autocrat . . . the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy‚Äîthe indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface. When a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the Russian fleet at Tsushima, he read it, stuffed it in his pocket, and went on playing tennis."""

politics,t5_2cneq,InOxladeITrust,t2_zwfaq,,"I was going to make a long reply about every ripple effect that would come from this. Instead I want to talk about one point you made because I feel it is the most important one. I don‚Äôt know how to do the copy/paste thing where it gets indented (on my phone), but you said ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want to keep the system afloat, that‚Äôs easy. Keep people in poverty, and watch things collapse. That‚Äôs what the Republicans generally do.‚Äù

First, I don‚Äôt think republicans want to keep people in poverty at all. The entire conservative philosophy is about giving everyone the same opportunity to succeed based on the merits of what they do. This could be a whole different argument though. 

Secondly, I would argue that a ‚Äúbasic income‚Äù does exactly what you don‚Äôt want, keeps people in poverty. Having an additional 24k a year sounds wonderful, but the entire economy would shift as result. It does nothing to give people the resources to move up in society. Everything would cost more. That‚Äôs just basic economics. With more money available, products cost more. In reality, you probably aren‚Äôt able to buy anything you couldn‚Äôt before (with the exception of the homeless). Anyone on unemployment probably has those checks stop coming. Why would unemployment continue to run when you are already getting 24k for existing? 

How does someone in this society go from the lower class to the middle class? Is it any different from how it is right now? Is the quality of life better for the bottom 1%? These are the questions to ask if you interested in this working for the poorest members of society. I don‚Äôt think a positive thing happens for those members of society imo. 

The next step is to ask about the quality of life for those in the middle class. I don‚Äôt think there is any question that it goes down though, right? Everything costs more, taxes for that class would go up, jobs in that bracket are likely to pay less. A result of all expenses for businesses going up is they have less money to pay employees that operate outside of a minimum wage."

politics,t5_2cneq,paxinfernum,t2_5nakr3py,,"Primaries aren't like General Elections. The parties are running elections to decide who best represents their team. So the candidates all want to win, but all of them are still on the same team and want to achieve their common goals, so it makes sense to be careful about damaging their own side. It's quite common for candidates in primaries to step down for the good of the team and endorse someone once they realize they have no chance of winning. Only Sanders supporters seem to not get this or think it's ""rigging"" or ""suspicious.""

It's like people on a boat arguing over who should lead them to shore. There may be bitter disagreements, but everyone on the boat understands that they have to make a decision and unite behind it even if it isn't their personal choice because they need to use all their time and resources effectively as a group to survive.

Sanders is the equivalent of the guy whose group is in a clear minority with no chance of winning fairly, but he's holding on to one of the paddles and demanding that the group revote over and over, even though they are running out of food. Meanwhile, a subset of his supporters are saying they'd rather set fire to the boat than see anyone but him lead the boat.

This is sort of par for the course for Sanders. He just doesn't get the give and take of group action. He's never really participated in any group in his life where he had any responsibility to the group. He's always joined associations and demanded they show a responsibility toward him, but he's never been willing to show loyalty in the other direction. His supporters see this as him being consistent. Others see it as him being a rigid asshole who takes and doesn't give anything back."

For example, the first point I mentioned, a $15 minimum wage, is in his plan to encourage unions and empower workers.

&gt;As Vice President, Biden helped get state and local laws increasing the minimum wage across the finish line ‚Äì including in New York State ‚Äì and has supported eliminating the tipped minimum wage. He firmly believes all Americans are owed a raise, and it‚Äôs well past time we increase the federal minimum wage to $15 across the country. This increase would include workers who aren‚Äôt currently earning the minimum wage, like the farmworkers who grow our food and domestic workers who care for our aging and sick and for those with disabilities. As president, Biden will also support indexing the minimum wage to the median hourly wage so that low-wage workers‚Äô wages keep up with those of middle income workers.

&gt;‚ÄúYou have a perfectly good answer in front of you, and instead you‚Äôre going to make another one up,‚Äù said one Republican close to the administration. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs purely ideological.‚Äù ...

&gt;That declaration surprised even some officials in the Health and Human Services Department, who believed the concept was still under consideration. And amid a crush of criticism from Democrats led by 2020 front runner Joe Biden, it worried officials who viewed the verdict as an unforced error in the middle of a historic pandemic. 

&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bad decision optics-wise,‚Äù one administration official said in the immediate aftermath. ‚ÄúIt politicizes people‚Äôs access to health services during a serious national health emergency.‚Äù ...

&gt;Health insurers that would be on the hook for covering the new population, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, had also thrown their vocal support behind the idea.

&gt;""A Special Enrollment Period would offer much needed coverage to millions of Americans and mitigate the potential impact on providers and hospitals which will be forced to rely on emergency funding,"" the Association of Community Health Plans wrote in a March letter to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma.

&gt;The move made sense to many in both the industry and Trump‚Äôs own administration, because Americans who lose their health insurance as a result of losing their job are already eligible to sign up for Obamacare outside of the traditional month-long enrollment period. With the coronavirus pandemic straining hospitals and the administration‚Äôs projections growing increasingly dire, health officials began signaling to insurers that it was preparing to give the broader pool of uninsured Americans a fresh shot at getting coverage, three people with knowledge of the discussions said. ...

&gt;If Trump had chosen instead to reopen the HealthCare.gov website ‚Äì as 11 largely blue states that control their own markets have already done ‚Äì people without insurance could buy more comprehensive policies that not only would cover coronavirus but any follow-up treatment, mental-health care, and future check-ups.  ...

Not only do we have to fight amongst ourselves, but now every other country is clumping us as one and the people in the US who despise Trump have to get shit on by not only his supporters in the US, but the rest of the world.

All I'm saying is the thinly veiled threats are fucking trash and you're going to make an entire country pay for something the POTUS said. In response to all the Canadian retaliation comments, you can bet I'll propose a comeback, and why wouldn't I use the most devastating form of retaliation as an example?

That's the problem with the US in general. It has only ever prepared for one type of conflict: outright, open physical conflict. Meaning traditional war.

It has no defense against intelligence war. It has no defense against guerrilla war. The list goes on. The US pours billions and billions into national defense but that national defense is primed to protect against old fashioned outright war. That doesn't exist anymore, because MAD ensures it doesn't. The US has been building up and up to take on a war that was never going to come the second nuclear missiles entered the equation on both sides.

It simply isn't prepared for a pandemic, it isn't prepared for intelligence warfare, it isn't prepared for anything else, and the seams are finally showing."

&gt;I think the 3.4 percent [number] is really a false number. Now, this is just my hunch, but based on and lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this and it is very mild. They will get better very rapidly, they don‚Äôt even see a doctor or call doctor, you never hear about those people so you can‚Äôt put them down in the category, in overall population in terms of this corona flu, or virus. So you just can‚Äôt do that.

&gt;So if, you know, we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better, just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work, some of them go to work, but they get better and then, when you do have a death like you had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California, I believe you had one in New York, you know, all of a sudden it seems like 3 or 4 percent, which is a very high number, as opposed to a fraction of 1 percent.

&gt;But again, they don‚Äôt know about the easy cases because the easy cases don‚Äôt go to the hospital, they don‚Äôt report to doctors or the hospital in many cases so I think that [the WHO] number is very high. I think the number, personally, **I would say the number is way under 1 percent.**

&gt;Now, with the regular flu, we average from 27,000 to 77,000 deaths a year. Who would think that? I never knew that until six or eight weeks ago, I asked that question, I said, ‚ÄòHow many people die of the flu?‚Äô You know, you keep hearing about ‚Äòflu shot, flu shot, take your flu shot,‚Äô but how many people die of the flu? And they said, ‚Äòsir, we lose between 27,000 and, you know, somewhere in the 70s‚Äô ‚Äî I think we went as high as 100,000 people died in 1990, if you can believe that, but a lot much people regardless. I think it averages about 36,000 people a year. So I said, ‚ÄòWow, that is a percentage that is under 1 percent, very substantially.‚Äô So it‚Äôd be interesting to see what difference is but again, a lot of people don‚Äôt report.

The seasonal flu doesn‚Äôt overwhelm entire hospitals, as it is doing in New York and other cities that have been too late to lock down their populations.

Once the hospital system is full, the general mortality rate of the population explodes because now there are no beds left to treat people for heart attacks, strokes, car accidents, you name it.

Trump downplayed the virus and called it a Democratic hoax against him even though he was told in January by the intelligence agencies about the coming pandemic, and the collapse of the healthcare system if the virus wasn‚Äôt contained. 

He said the cases in the US would go from 15 to 0. That it would magically disappear when the weather heated up. That he would open the country back up by easter.

And now he says 120,000 Americans will die.

Thus the proportion of mammalian species capable of flight is [~23%](https://www.google.com/search?q=1240%2F5341).

+ The US expected average daily mortality rate is [~8,000](https://www.google.com/search?q=331%2C000%2C000*%288.880%2F1000%29%2F365) deaths per day. This is a ""normal"" amount of dead Americans.  ([population](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) * [per capita](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate)

+ The US contains only [4.25%](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) of the world population but approximately [25%](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) of worldwide confirmed cases of COVID 19 are within the US.

+ The combined populations of [New York and New Jersey](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_population) is approximately one half the population of [Italy](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/), but they have more confirmed cases combined than Italy to date. ([133,000](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/) vs [119,000](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/)). This is with [Italy testing] (https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/02/826368789/fact-check-trump-claims-u-s-testing-for-coronavirus-most-per-capita-its-not) at a higher rate than either [NY or NJ is testing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericmack/2020/03/26/see-how-much-coronavirus-testing-is-happening-in-each-state/).

politics,t5_2cneq,technical_assistance,t2_2irmf2c8,:flag-us: America,"&gt;The White House instead rejected the prospect of allowing new sign-ups across the 38 Affordable Care Act marketplaces it controls ‚Äì a decision that shocked the health care industry, triggered widespread criticism and prompted a scramble within the administration to find a new way to care for the growing population left exposed to the pandemic. ...

&gt;‚ÄúYou have a perfectly good answer in front of you, and instead you‚Äôre going to make another one up,‚Äù said one Republican close to the administration. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs purely ideological.‚Äù ...

&gt;That declaration surprised even some officials in the Health and Human Services Department, who believed the concept was still under consideration. And amid a crush of criticism from Democrats led by 2020 front runner Joe Biden, it worried officials who viewed the verdict as an unforced error in the middle of a historic pandemic. 

&gt;‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bad decision optics-wise,‚Äù one administration official said in the immediate aftermath. ‚ÄúIt politicizes people‚Äôs access to health services during a serious national health emergency.‚Äù ...

&gt;Health insurers that would be on the hook for covering the new population, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, had also thrown their vocal support behind the idea.

&gt;""A Special Enrollment Period would offer much needed coverage to millions of Americans and mitigate the potential impact on providers and hospitals which will be forced to rely on emergency funding,"" the Association of Community Health Plans wrote in a March letter to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma.

&gt;The move made sense to many in both the industry and Trump‚Äôs own administration, because Americans who lose their health insurance as a result of losing their job are already eligible to sign up for Obamacare outside of the traditional month-long enrollment period. With the coronavirus pandemic straining hospitals and the administration‚Äôs projections growing increasingly dire, health officials began signaling to insurers that it was preparing to give the broader pool of uninsured Americans a fresh shot at getting coverage, three people with knowledge of the discussions said. ...

&gt;If Trump had chosen instead to reopen the HealthCare.gov website ‚Äì as 11 largely blue states that control their own markets have already done ‚Äì people without insurance could buy more comprehensive policies that not only would cover coronavirus but any follow-up treatment, mental-health care, and future check-ups.  ...

&gt;The White House decision also caught the hospital industry off guard, frustrating executives who spent the past week awaiting guidance for how strained front-line facilities could access the new funding."

So IMO, its not ""Fascism"" thats the creates problems, its the values or some of the values that constitute it.  When we attribute the problems to the labels, not the values that make up the ideology we end up with hyperbole of the highest order.  It becomes much easier to simply change the label of something to ""fascist"" than to prove that all the values line up with fascism but both can have profound effects.  Just like how sanders' version of socialism is very different from previous forms but have the same label nonetheless.

Whats that phrase? History doesn't repeat itself but it does rhyme?

It seems to me to be the case.  To me, the biggest thing keeping the US from its goals is all the hyperbole, and the movement from people thinking the problem is someone else's beliefs to the problem being the people themselves.
If you have a conflict over beliefs that can have a happy ending.  Beliefs can change.  A conflict of perceived good vs evil cannot end well for everyone."

From u/The-Autarkh

[Excellent thread by fmr. US Attorney Barbara McQuade](https://twitter.com/BarbMcQuade/status/1205353357180833792?s=19) disposing of Banana Republicans' ridiculous attempted defenses of Donald one by one.

----

&gt;Here are the GOP defenses I have heard so far to articles of impeachment, along with the knee-jerk responses I have been shouting at my television.

----

&gt;**Defense 1**: Trump did nothing wrong. 

&gt;**Response**: Trump hit the trifecta of impeachable conduct by subverting an election, seeking foreign influence, and putting personal interest ahead of national interest. And he obstructed Congress by refusing to produce any witnesses or documents

----

&gt;**Defense 2**: No harm occurred because the military aid went through. 

&gt;**Response**: The aid went through only after Trump was caught. In the meantime, months of delay cost Ukraine lives in its war with Russia. US credibility was harmed and moral authority to fight corruption was eroded.

----

&gt;**Defense 3**: Because aid went through, no misconduct was committed.

&gt;**Response**: Bribery occurs upon demand for a personal favor in exchange for performance of an official act. If you offer a cop $20 to get out of a traffic ticket, even if he declines, you have still committed bribery

----

&gt;**Defense 4**: Abuse of power is not even a crime. 

&gt;**Response**: Impeachable conduct may be criminal conduct, but need not be. A president could be impeached if he watched TV all day and failed to fulfill his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.

----

&gt;**Defense 5**: There‚Äôs nothing wrong with asking for an investigation. 

&gt;**Response**: If this were legitimate investigation, you wouldn‚Äôt need to send your personal lawyer and his henchmen to do it. Witnesses say Trump didn‚Äôt want investigation, just announcement of investigation.

----

&gt;**Defense 6**: There was no quid pro quo. 

&gt;[**Response**:] Read the transcript! Trump‚Äôs request for a ‚Äúfavor‚Äù is strong evidence, corroborated by witness testimony, of months-long scheme to get Zelensky to ‚Äúgo to the mic‚Äù and announce Biden probe. Aid was leverage.

----

&gt;**Defense 7**: As VP, Biden held up aid as leverage to get rid of the Ukrainian public prosecutor. 

&gt;**Response**: It is appropriate for a president or VP to take action to advance the interests of the nation. Trump was advancing his personal interests.

----

&gt;**Defense 8**: Testimony is hearsay.

&gt;**Response**: Rules of Evidence don‚Äôt apply. Also, call summary, Sondland testimony are non-hearsay. Trump has barred direct witnesses. You can‚Äôt have it both ways. If they had information favorable to Trump, you can bet we would have heard from them.

----

&gt;**Defense 9**: It happens all the time. Get over it. 

&gt;**Response**: Trump sought foreign influence in our election and harmed national security by delaying aid designed to fight Russia, our adversary. We don‚Äôt have to accept it. We deserve better.

----

&gt;**Defense 10**: Impeachment would un-do an election. 

&gt;**Response**: All impeachments un-do elections. Constitution permits impeachment if president is unfit to serve. When rigging an election is involved, elections are ineffective for removal. Impeachment is not to punish but to protect.

----

&gt;**Defense 11**: Impeachment proceedings are moving too fast. 

&gt;**Response**: This impeachment has moved slower than Bill Clinton‚Äôs and on pace with Richard Nixon‚Äôs. For a president who presents a clear and present danger to national security, removal is urgent and can‚Äôt come soon enough

----

&gt;**Defense 12**: We need to hear from the whistleblower. 

&gt;**Response**: The whistleblower was a tipster, whose tip led to the investigation. Tipsters do not testify at trial, the witnesses do. We have a duty to protect whistleblowers to encourage them to use proper channels to report abuse"

This analogy fails because it assumes the USA would offset its theft of material by contributing its much larger and more powerful military, in which case of course it's alright if they take the lion's share of munitions. Canada probably doesn't have the infrastructure nor the use for, let's say, 20 TLAMS, but a single American Arleigh Burke would, and has the fire control systems to make the most out of those missiles. Assuming that by ""we"" you meant Canada, the US, and NATO, are all against a common enemy. If America was fighting someone alone and he used DPA on an American company I don't think anyone would give a shit.

In the fight against COVID-19, prioritizing supplies to America grants no such advantage; everything the US can do medically, everyone can do as well, and HAS been doing. If this was for the only sample of a life saving vaccine, you COULD argue the greater infrastructure of the USA could be used to mass produce, but this is just masks. Everyone in every country gets the same use out of them. It isn't a cruise missile, or something, where the launch platform is going to vary wildly in accuracy and capacity based on the country that fired it."

He's a successful Asian American. Would he have been as successful if he wasn't embraced by the American Hip Hop culture? Now, him being a ""cool"" Asian kid probably paid dividends growing up while the cultured Asian kids were more than likely getting picked on. I'm an Asian American. I grew up in Long Beach, CA in the late 80's and early 90's. I lived through a race war. To a lot of the misguided Asian youth, gangs were an American thing. A lot of us picked that up and fought back and it effectively ended Asians being picked on in Long Beach. Go down a few miles on the 405 and you have an Asian community in Westminster that embraced their American-ness by opening small businesses. Worked out wonderfully for them. Why do people think American equates to being white. These woke Asians are behind their 5k laptops dragging another Asian American for voicing his opinion on how to deal with the surge of racism. These woke Asians want him to say, fuck this, fight back! but you know what? to a lot of Asian Americans, that isn't their way of showing American-ness.

Now what have these woke Asians done to help mitigate the surge of Asian racism? besides inciting the infighting amongst Asians. Besides staying quiet when Andrew Yang was being dragged by MSM. When they were blatantly racist calling him John Yang and Andrew Chang. Where were they? I know, sitting back quietly and waiting for the moment to step on another Asian American to boost their presence on social media. FAKE ASIAN WOKNESS. A bunch of opportunist that suddenly became AA activists. 

The sudden surge of AA wokeness is fake as hell. They don't give a damn about other Asian Americans. They care about themselves and their circle. I'm willing to bet that most of you guys don't know that 45 years AFTER resettlement, a good portion of South East Asian Americans still live in poverty. Some have poor educational attainment levels. A lot of them rely on government programs. How come these fake woke Asians don't bring that up. Why don't they come out and see why South East Asian Americans differ from ""their Asian"". Why not trend that topic amongst their blue check Asian community. 

Instead of dragging another Asian American because of an opinion that can easily be taken out of context, why not reach out and talk about the sensitivity it caused. Why not reach out and create something to empower ALL Asian Americans through the non-profit Andrew is pushing.

And the fact that it would pay off was a lie. He was claiming there would be less health costs, even though there would be no reason for that. The cost would only be higher, because more people would have access to healthcare. Or the quality would have gotten worse. Like it does in every western country that has a central healthcare system. Calling something a right doesn't make it immune to scarcity and it doesn't make it free to build and maintain. On the one hand, you don't trust the government with stuff, on the other hand you want them to have complete control of the healthcare of every citizen. If you want to get taxed more and you don't like your money, make a fund with your berniebros and give your own money to those that aren't insured. Don't try to take mine. Let people spend it how they want. The only people that should be in favor of this plan is people that don't want to work ever and are basically parasites. And idiots, obviously.

I am not arguing in favor of bailouts, I think they are stupid and basically dirty money to their friends. Obama did it. Trump will do it. I just don't like taxes. I think people should choose where their money goes. If you don't intend to be productive in the society, sucks to suck.

&gt;""This tracker will update daily with new polling data about Americans‚Äô reactions to the coronavirus pandemic.""

I have no idea what your point is. They do update daily - that doesn't mean they aren't a lagging indicator. They simply take today's polls as they are released and include them in their running average (which also includes older polls). It has the effect of evening out the bumps (outliers are averaged out) but makes the results lag by a few days if not a week .

&gt;Are you really swing Politico is not biased?
&gt;With that aside, we all have to take polling for what it is...crap. 

Polls aren't biased or crap. Polls are literally math based science. The problem is that the interpretation of the polls can be flawed or biased. In 2016 538 gave Trump about a 25% chance of winning the day before the election. People are idiots and don't understand that 25% != 0%. For every four elections you have with a 75/25 split the underdog will win one. 538 wasn't wrong - and the polls weren't wrong. The pollsters just made bad assumptions about who would and wouldn't show up.

Also, if 538 proposes you should say yes - they're the best in the business. They're just not the most current."

because their policies are somehow even less representative of my views, duh? my entire point is that i find the democrats to be too far to the right to represent my views how is voting to the right of them solving my issue?

&gt;so I guess you don't see climate change as an issue, don't see immigration reform as important, don't see a higher minimum wage or support for labor regulations as important, don't see liberal justices on the Supreme Court or campaign finance reform as important, don't see a public option for healthcare as an improvement over the status quo, etc

see the reason i hate the democratic party is because i do care about things (except public option - i think m4a is a no brainers and is my number one gripe with biden). i'm sorry but you cant convince someone who has lived through obama's presidency that the democratic party will be effective at addressing climate change, healthcare, labor rights, us foreign policy, immigration, or even the fucking supreme court. and biden's whole appeal as vp was that he was the *centrist* democratic. how the fuck am i supposed to get excited to vote for biden knowing that? the democrats do not give a fuck about the working class. they are corrupt politicians beholden to millionaire and billionaire mega donors, just like the gop. i am simply done enabling and supporting a party that is contributing to this problem. again, i believe that the complete failure of the democratic party to improve the lives of the working class is what gave us trump.

And -- but I also want to emphasize that the ship is operationally capable and can do its mission if -- if required to do so.

So the ship is pulling into Guam. It will be pier-side. No one on the crew will be allowed to leave anywhere into Guam other than on pier-side. And we are already starting the process of testing 100 percent of the crew to ensure that -- that we've got that contained.
