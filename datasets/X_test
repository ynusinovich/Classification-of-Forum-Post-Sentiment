My guess is Bernie has already been paid off....just like last time.
Let me tell you where she can shove that guitar...
Is it
A Cuomo lying Surely you jest
The states have police powers under the 10th Amendment. Your rights stop when they interfere with the rights of others. You can own a firearm but you can't use that firearm to kill others without justification or an excuse. The states have always had the authority to create time place and manner restraints on the right to assembly that especially holds true during an emergency. I don't believe shelter in place can continue indefinitely we must come up with better testing and treatment and get ahead of this. But for the time being stop being a dick and shelter in place as much as you are able.
As a Canadian I know exactly how we will retaliate. We will write a letter asking for the masks back. Then if Trump says no we will apologize and go home
Remember that she auditioned for this role w the Justice Democrats.
Enough did that it happened is still not most.
Americans are capable of doing a lot of things from the bottom to the top and was just trying to give a little inspiration but c'est la vie. We'll rebound... either that or a bunch of people who haven't been through really hard times will get to find out how bad things could actually be. P
The fact y all think that shows how gullible and ignorant you are. It s ironic too considering y all support the most incompetent president in recent history
democrats Trump is Hitler Also democrats we need the government to take those guns
That's not how Republicans in power think. That's just how the rubes think. The ones in power don't give a shit about the rubes they hurt because they know the rest will turn on them anyway.
It's clearly a sock puppet comment stack.
So how long until she either leaves the democratic party or they kick her out
My god you give us a bad name...
No. I just think that your full of shit. I think you watch CNN and MSNBC religiously. I think your favorite sub here is r politics. I think you fancy yourself an intellectual and try to talk around your ideology to make yourself feel like you're being neutral and objective. Yet it's clear that you think less of anyone who isn't of a liberal ideology.
Scumbag fact checker claims that there's no relationship between funding college for illegal aliens and not funding more ventilators. Yet money is fungible and priorities need to be made. New York has been quite clear that its priorities have been aid for illegal aliens and abortion on demand for the past half decade. This sleazy article also lets Cuomo off the hook by squealing that although the state of New York's report found the need to have 18 000 more ventilators it never recommended that the state purchase more. Oh okay.
It hasn't even been a year since that call Time flies when there's a new horror every day.
There are the white N95 with the plastic piece everyone thinks of and the green N95 surgical style masks that health care professionals use.
Lt Colonel or battalion commander is something to be proud of but honestly in terms of high ranking officers it's pretty far down. Theres roughly 10 000 Lt Colonel's within the Army. Definitely not a decision maker on a big picture level.
Agree with your first point. January and February were squanderd. And I accept the apology. I disagree that Kushner is saying that the federal stockpile isn't for the states. I think he is saying that it shouldn't be the individual state's sole stockpile. I agree that the feds were unprepared. But so were the states. And they both should have been. And they both deserve ctitizism over their lack of preparedness.
It s in within the first 2 paragraphs. nytimes.com And personally man I don t give a shit if he calls it the china virus it s just incorrect and unpresidential
The clean up of Trump has to start with the new President firing Bill Barr and putting Adam Schiff in his role.
Ya all the spirit cooking Celebrities great.... they wont want nothing in return s
gt Can you point to a journalistic source saying that it can't be a possible treatment That's not how medicine works. At all. If there was already a body of evidence that heavily suggested this is a proper treatment then your question would be valid. But that isn't the case here and we can't run around saying xyz drug works for sickness x just because nobody has merely proven it doesn't work.
My favorite argument was a poster claimed that the government would negotiate for better pricing so taxes wouldn't be wasted. Is this the same government that pays 500 for a box of pencils so their department doesn't get budget cuts
The same one that killed more people
Orange fan mad
Well if habeus corpus is suspended he could throw people in jail for anything. Or nothing.
But insert anecdotal relative is dramatic story and was otherwise insert healthy demographic here We must keep the government locked down to flatten the curve because insert appeal to authority fallacy here and virtue signal because otherwise people will die
Distracting to lesser stuff Donnie Don't think we're not gonna find out just how many died because of you and your Admin.
That s how voting works

The Allies of World War I came to call it the Spanish flu primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship
gt Where's this burgeoning right wing religious ethnostate and its army of advocates Certainly not in this community. Congratulations on claiming you could speak for every individual in this community of several thousand regular users. That's a very smart move that will very likely convince more people than the reactionary circlejerk here. Of course your argument is bullshit. You can't speak for everyone here and you don't know everyone here. Playing the victim though Check. The truth is the homogenous ethnostate is something an extreme fringe group would support. They do exist for a matter of fact on the far right political spectrum and in this community because they share a lot of the very same rethoric you use. But I pointed out the exclusionary nationalism for a reason because that one is widespread here and it's only a precursor for the ethnostate.
Oh shit is ya do that and that would be the end of the US as you know it.. Ya dont fuck with Canada and its hockey..
Thank god I have a calcamachine on my phone. Phew.
It sounds like you know a lot more about this than I do. My specialty is fairly removed from this kind of stuff

I know the lyrics to Imagine I m not stupid. Just because he wrote a song doesn t mean he was a communist. He knew the song was hypocritical especially from his point of view and even changed the lyrics a little bit in a live performance. He has also said he wasn t a communist.
So this bitch kills her husband yet the left and MSM embrace her and sensationalize her story because Orange man bad
It's almost like you 17 year olds lack any ability to understand that elections will not be held if you cannot have public gatherings and Presidents historically benefit from crisis during election cycles. Public school showing ineptitude once again.
We have no idea how many cases we actually have because people aren't being tested. But that said there are other ways these morons can kill us.
Actually that would be pretty great. Hunter seems pretty entertaining.
I picked blueberries two years ago just for myself. I picked 51 pounds of blueberries in an hour and a half. Roughly 30 pounds an hour. The labor rate doesn't change my price of blueberries in the store much at all.

Understanding the nature of a deadly virus and then neglecting to act correctly on that information would be seen as intentionally endangering others. At the very least it s negligence.
Sometimes I feel bothered when the temperature suddenly changes and I heard that's a symptom but maybe I'm just cold lol What does this have to do with masks
Ship them to Canada..I have been there twice beautiful country great people..
As long as Communist China exists and this type of shit is going on I will default to suspecting them. I don t think that s an unreasonable way of thinking. Especially knowing what we know about their government and the people supporting them.
Nah go fuxk yourself with your unreal stereotype.
Just need to build a high speed line between the East and west coasts and we ll be set.
No justice would mean prosecuting convicting and imprisoning the Democrats that attempted to nullify the 2016 election.
Yes.
Exactly and it's even constitutional since we would be providing for the common good. It's also pretty important from a national security perspective that something like this never happen again. The thing is corporations have certain constraints on them that are fundamentally at odds with providing high quality life long care. Different corporations manage that conflict with varying degrees of deftness but it's a conflict that you can not get away from.
And yet there are already people who actually need it not able to get their prescriptions filled because of this. Also he's not recommending because there's no good evidence it works at this time which is why he called for further study. This drug is very harsh on the body in mild covid cases the drug could be more harmful to them than the disease itself. To blindly use it because it might help is idiotic.

He is just staying in the race for now incase Biden dies
Elections have consequences. You vote for these idiots this is what you can expect.
Could not agree more. We control the government and WE want it to enforce stay at home laws so that the people we love and even people we may not know don't die unnecessarily. I can't tell those idiot spring breakers to stay home but the government sure as shit can and you're damn right I want it to. I love my parents.
Well she claimed that but I haven t seen evidence of that. If she does it would absolve her. But ya they def have info normal people don t. For sure.
Overdue.
gt You know in April supposedly it dies with the hotter weather. And that's a beautiful date to look forward to he said in a Fox Business interview on February 10. gt You know a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat as the heat comes in. Typically that will go away in April he told governors that same day. gt Looks like by April you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away. I hope that's true he said at a New Hampshire campaign rally the same day. Any Trump supporter that would volunteer to defend this Or is this still not good enough to convince you that you shouldn't vote for him again
Who's the Boss
Fucking impeach him again or something just get him out of office already. He's clearly an idiot.
gt Kushner has established his own shadow task force overseeing the government s efforts on the coronavirus at times duplicating or displacing what the official task force is doing as Kushner issues orders across the government and nobody is quite sure who is in charge. Best management practices right there. If you want to create chaos and fail that is.
Alright man well you sound like a medical professional who knows what he s talking about. I m glad some people here are allowed to speak eloquently on this subject here...
Hard to be open minded if you are only allowed in your tribes communities. I think this goes along the line of twitter overwhelmingly supported Bernie but Biden is still ahead. I m sure the effects of social media visibility of far left opinion on the public is understated. Ala Hollywood

gt I have no idea what to do about it. Once my parents pass I will have to seriously consider leaving this country. This is a question I've struggled with when do you decide that it's time to leave your country It's a question I never ever thought I would have to consider.
Putin didnt become president again till May 2012 and relations were with Russia were pretty good with Medvedev as president. So he wasnt exactly right at the time. Apparently when putin firet met with Obama he complained about a bunch of things that happened under bush like the U.S invading Iraq and getting out of the ABM treaty and relations soured from there. Putin also blamed the state department for an earlier uprising in Russia and that's why he strongly opposed Clinton becoming president.
He also still has his commission so he's still collecting his full paycheck. Probably gave up his sea pay maybe a command at sea entitlement.
gt You'll see the big line up for the soup kitchen. Oh no where will America find those rarest of all commodities 2000 calories a day and a bed to sleep in. Impossible to imagine.

Of course they do. Whom do you think is indoctrinating these twats at CNN and MSNBC
Because these aren t reasonable people. They don t give a shit about people period. Watch when the red states really need the aid in the coming weeks he ll leave them high and dry too. Just look how he handled Houston during their natural disaster.
Fox is disgusting and anyone who watches it for actual information must be fucking stupid.

Why don t they go ahead and launch an investigation of the IRS Agent that I saw on the news bilked an 85 year old widow out of her life savings These incessant investigations with no possible negative outcome for Trump are just another facet of his reality show. He s just going to pull in enough of the middle of the road folks with these always picking on me claims. Sorry if it s not a popular opinion but this is not a good strategy to get him out.
I heard Trump gave exclusive production rights to Gilead for producing some drug that might work in a year. The hucksters are working overtime to score on this crisis.
gt You have to start asking your moderate to conservative friends and family how much of this they will take This is a daily argument I have with my dad. Two years ago I asked my dad what it would take for my dad to support leaving Trump. My dad said that if Trump falsified his taxes he would disown Trump. Well here it is April 2020 and he still supports Trump even though the man if you can even call Trump that boy or child is more apt has demonstrably shown his contempt of the IRS and attempts to evade being held accountable for his tax returns. Earlier this week I asked him if he still supports Trump even after his mismanagement of the coronavirus response. Sure enough my dad still supports Trump because 80 000 people die of the flu each year and nobody cares. Our country will be very fortunate if we survive COVID 19 with that number of deaths. Dr. Fauci's low estimate is 100 000. Higher estimates project upward of 2. 2 million people within the US alone. In comparison... 2400 American deaths in Pearl Harbor history.com 2977 American deaths in the 9 11 Terror Attacks en.wikipedia.org 7000 American soldier deaths in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined atson.brown.edu 7402 orldometers.info deaths lt We are here for the USA's coronavirus death count as of 4 4 2020 58 000 American soldier deaths in the Vietnam War britannica.com 418 500 American deaths in WW2 including soldiers and US civilians caught in conflict nationalww2museum.org 500 000 Americans deaths in the American civil war pbs.org 2. 2 million deaths in the US is more American deaths than all American waged wars COMBINED.
How does it divide the country
You can sue anyone for typing words on reddit.
I didn't mention the media or congres or anything. the media is attacking trump but it s very beside the point. Also I didn t mention Cuomo or NYC or anything. Let's stop with this left right fighting because it s not doing anyone any good. Personally I am very disappointed in his response and if he would have urged companies to produce ventilators earlier assured the tests would be enough to start it earlier assured supplies for medical professionals from january when he knew it was a pandemic before everyone knew it's a pandemic youtube.com v HOneVW5gA3U t 28s youtube.com v HOneVW5gA3U t 28s here.
She did that after leaving ESPN nobody thought of or cared what she had to say. Then she re emerged to say dumb shit like that. People like her just want to make it about themselves. They are very dangerous.
He said something mean about Trump probably.
That is insane. Wait til it s time for another war than it ll be time to die for freedom you have until we decide you might die if you keep it.
Just another piece of shit being shitty.

No it went they stayed but they were given a choice. So you're right.
So you'd posit that she then poisoned herself with the same substance to create an alibi That's very astute I think you're probably on to something there.
It will be like most of their attempts for this stuff they will say it s a shocking pearl clutching bombshell and then they will have a nothing burger. Then it will piss off independents who don t want tax dollars spent on this stuff and Trump will get re elected in 2020 and they will all act shocked as to why he got re elected and they will cry voter fraud and throw a 2 year old tantrum until 2024
I hate this man more than anything but no.. this is not the time for an impeachment.
No. If you fall due to tough economic times pull yourself up by your bootstraps and get back into the workforce Don t depend on the government s money work for it

Excuse me Melania is now an official Seriously
gt Americans are dying. gt Trump is stroking his mushroom. Man I'm surprised it's Friday.. that sounds more like a Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday to be honest.
gt You can t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism. There must be a better distribution of wealth and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism. amp x200B gt Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all God s children. amp x200B gt The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and evils of racism.

Uber leftyDemSocBernieBro here. Respect. We will never ever agree on everything but we can all agree someone dedicated to a code of honor amp dignity in these times deserves some admiration.
It's not even that people suck tbh. I live in a tourist heavy town that is close to a big city and a lot of people visit my town on the weekends. It's normal from a rational perspective one person matters very little and does not decide the total amount of visitors to the town. Thus an externality needs to be internalized by raising the risk of going outside for no reason t. going to visit a town with a lot of people for leisure It's basic logic which somehow passes by the crybaby libertarians. Go watch libertarian party presidential debate these are the people that are in this thread. Legit loonies.

He s 100 full of shit and looking for attention.
But if we don t know where it goes he can funnel it to shady businesses which he either has indirect control over or from who he will get kickbacks. Without oversight it would be easy for him to just funnel a great deal of the money to himself or to his friends family. Can t tell if you really don t realize this or if you re trolling
It's just a meme
It is quite evident already
I'm absolutely curious to see how the left is going to find fault with this. And they will
I mean sure I used to bike to work every day. Now I m working from home commuting via car. But you think America will be known as a world super power because it says fuck it let the fatties die This virus could affect the US worse than others with the fact that there is mass unemployment which leads to more and more people without health insurance. All while a large portion of this country is overweight which is deadlier to them. And you re fine with letting your fellow Americans be at risk
That s cute. Have you been away
This isnt true. My friend is illegal but he still has to pay full taxes. Nobody wants to mess woth the IRS. Doesn't qualify for anything at all though. So no tax breaks or anything so he does technically end up paying a higher percentage. There is truth to this
I don t watch msm is there a link to any segments or think pieces claiming the travel ban is racist
Secrecy is not the point. He was simply drawing attention to the fact that they were still there as they will always be. Just a little reminder of how some people still believe in and respect something and some people who they never knew the American Soldiers who gave all so that we can be here in some semblance of peace. They don t do it for the pat on the back. It s an honor to even be chosen to do it. You want to know who else are absolute badasses The dudes who perform military funerals. The Pall Bearers.

We now have governors mayors and others that are literally placing people under house arrest more than 3 4 of the nation's population is under such orders and some including in Kentucky are literally putting ankle bracelets on ordinary citizens to compel compliance.

gt others ran several stories at the beginning of the global outbreak that compared Covid 19 to the seasonal flu. But those stories were written in January well before the disease spread to the United States and wrought havoc to devastating effect in Italy Spain and other parts of Europe. gt Reporting by the New York Times indicates that for two weeks in late February and early March when the pandemic began to take off in the United States Fox News was more focused on providing cover for Donald Trump s posture on the issue than the dissemination of the facts.
Now I do not have any recent evidence to back this up but personally I find it more likely that he works in the white house so he doesn't go on record about how he has been cucked by his FIL for his entire marriage.

I literally just texted my friend that based on the posts in r navy regarding what happened at Great Lakes it's not a matter of if but when I will personally get it.

Yeah theyre pretty worthless if they cant even teach journalism in its purest form. Also doesnt help that most journalism students are young easily impressionable and easily radicalized idealists. Ive studied journalism with such folk and believe me a lot of them wouldnt be that way if theyve experienced actual abuse and a troubled childhood like I have. I've learned from a young age that everything is nuanced and not everything is black and white. And that I even after getting information from sources don't know everything and shouldnt write as if I do. Unfortunately almost everyone in the modern newsroom thinks they do. Would you believe it if I told you we were required to memorize a code of journalistic ethics by heart for an entire semester and had to recite it perfectly at the end of the following semesters Even I dont believe that actually happened with all these unethical practices going around.

True US Coronavirus numbers are 10x or more higher than official reports because there are not enough tests available.

I saw him call himself a libertarian many times. I think one of those was when he was on Reuben s show. In any case he definitely favors small government but he favors a lockdown. That was my point
And Biden's voters wouldn't support Bernie. I swear everyone who makes the Bernie's voters wouldn't support Biden seem to forget that Bernie wouldn't automatically have the Democratic Party voters. Your argument depends on Bernie voters being unwilling to settle and moderate Democrats being willing to get in line behind someone they think is a socialist communist words they were taught to hate. It's not about the reality because they're not hearing it and Bernie as the nominee doesn't have the numbers among people who actually reliably vote. Biden will have to fight for Bernie voters but that's what we're stuck with.

I can't believe these people are called journalists. I spent 3 years on a journalism course in college and the amount of standards of ethics broken and incompetence needed to connect a medicinal treatment to be administered by licensed doctors to a story about a couple ingesting clearly labeled toxic fishtank cleaner is insane. Just don't bother with most news articles written by some random office only journalist. Right now the most trustworthy source of information comes from on site in the field journalism but even then be aware that stories in one area can't always be extrapolated as happening to everywhere. Just because one hospital is lacking supplies doesnt mean all of them are. On site hospital staff are stressed out and most likely resent current administration's handling due to being overworked.

gt In September the United States secretly expelled two employees of the Chinese Embassy in Washington who had been caught driving on a sensitive military base in Virginia with their wives it appeared to be the first expulsion of Chinese diplomats accused of espionage in more than 30 years.

Trump has more Facebook followers than Abraham Lincoln. Ergo Trump is the greatest president ever. It is our patriotic duty to replace Washington Jefferson Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt on Mount Rushmore with Donald Trump Ivanka Putin and Fred Trump.

2 3 million will die as a consequence of the virus. You're not factoring in deaths from crime or lack of food shelter or adequate medical care caused by the economic fallout.
Ah good to know.
This great suppression I believe is going to have the best chance out of anything else that has ever happened to be the end of the American economy and the United States and we know them. Complete government control over the economy running it into the ground as quickly as they possibly can and then people bow right down when they get 1200 which is supposed to compensate for months of lost wages. I'm not going to say that this was deliberately released by China but information about it was deliberately suppressed which is equally bad. This was not a biological weapon against America it was a psychological one and it worked incredibly well. The people of the United States have been brainwashed into living in constant fear of the short term believing it's governments job to provide services and equity instead of you know governing. And now the United States is ripping itself apart because they believe that lives now are worth more than lives a year from now. It's complete tyranny exactly what the second amendment warned us about and they didn't even have to raise a gun the people have finally given in. China has successfully used our own governments to turn America against everything that made it great.

Here is the breakdown of votes against the hurricane Sandy relief bill govtrack.us They only nay votes came from republicans. Because they didnt give a fuck. Hurricane Harvey Same story different players time.com Because this time the folks from texas didnt feel so good about people voting against aid for their constituents but once again republicans made sure to let it be known that helping people impacted by hurricanes is not something their party can be relied on to do.
Thee oligarchs are trying to take over the army by filling it with yes man. Shit we are so fucked if we don't fix the course we're on. They already took over Congress they're eroding our institutions they're packing the courts. It might already be too late.

THIS is the difference between a conservative and a leftist. I don't care what they do. They can sit by their windows eating take out burger after burger while looking for fucking unicorns. Conservatives just want to be left alone. The current impositions especially in some states are lunacy. Time to all grow up put on big boy pants and make your own decisions.
So we will see a leak of that next week
In what way
I saw people talking about how Trump made this all happen and gave us the worse numbers possible for unemployment and everything else. Like people you were SO quiet the first 3. 5 years when the unemployment was historically low and the market was at an all time high and now you want to talk about his numbers
I have never seen so much projection before in my entire fucking life. You are wrong about EVERY part of that unimaginably fucking stupid rant. I don t give a single fuck what color trump is. I only care about his actions. And his actions are filled with ignorance hypocrisy and gas lighting. He complained on several occasions during Obamas presidency that the president should not he golfing and instead should be working for the people. Yet within trumps second year in office he already had golfed more then Obama had in his entire 8 year presidency. And he now has golfed over 2. 5x as much as Obama did in his 8 years and yet he is still only in his 3rd year as president. Obama also took far better actions in preventing the spread of the diseases he had during his presidency. So stop with the but Hillary but Obama but Pelosy and actually address the criticism made against your commander in queef. TRUMP IS PRESIDENT. NOT HILLARY NOT OBAMA. So stop brining them up the second anything negative is said about commander fuckwit. I was not on reddit during obamas presidency either. But I made many criticisms of him while he was president. And to this day I still don t regard him as that amazing of a president. Lastly I have never watched CNN for anything but the weather. And even then I have access to phones now so I don t even watch them for that anymore. Now pull Trumps dick out of your throat so your brain can finally get some oxygen. And once you are no longer an ignorant fucking child you can then come back and talk like an adult.
Yeah I always read them to my husband but I never respond.
Um what
Thank you.
You would more than pentuple whatever death rate you end up with as things are.
Why do you think you are making a valid argument I just told you. The United States of America is spreading the virus. We aren't taking enough precautions. We don't have enough medical supplies especially PPE. Houston is already a hotbed of virus. Dallas is too. ICE was responsible for letting over 900 known cases of mumps happen in its facilities refusing free vaccines for diseases that have vaccines and now the coronavirus is in those facilities. What have they been doing Putting detainees on airplanes which spread the virus due to the close quarters and shared ventilation and flying detainees back and forth across the United States. You should ask them why they are helping the virus spread.
It always will be until we start I am 40 this isn't a new topic
I am not an expert either. I read and listen to far too much about all of this. From what I gather if things are to reopen in May the economy can rebound fairly quickly. The problem is how long the shutdown lasts and what happens once we are open again. If it lasts longer businesses that could possibly weather the storm for a month or two will come back. Those that cannot wait that long will close and those jobs will take a lot longer to return. Would you open a restaurant in two months once others are closed I would not. The risk is too high. My other thought is that once we start working again things will get worse. It will spread faster. Just my thoughts.
If only the u.s population rioted to such a point that ever federal building in DC were put to the torch and every elite jackass reminded how little their authority protects from what could br the most lethally armed mob capable of assembling in the world and I'm willing to bet service are a bit tired of being used as tools of oppression I would hate to give any ideas but NATO vehicles dont require keys to start and are never locked unless in use...
Fake news. The truth is that during the hurricane the sentinels were given the choice to leave. They opted to stay. Hope that clears things up.
Assuming new airline companies won t be founded. It s a free market.
To Trump elimination of those who aren't loyal to him and him alone are Trump's top priority. There could be over 300 million deaths in the USA and as long as Trump got rid of anyone who would dare speak against him politically he would consider that as a win.... Elect a narcissist everything revolves around them...
As a physician as well I have a question for you regarding point 2 How do you anticipate people getting it without a prescription from a physician You ask people not to take it if they dont need it and not to play with things you dont know but you cant get it without a doctor writing prescription. So shouldnt your plea as a physician be directed towards other physicians I'm just really confused by this rhetoric that I frequently see. Please help me understand.
gt Presidents cannot cancel elections. Presidents can't do a lot of things that Trump does and gets away with.

No sure you responded to the right comment as you didn t answer my questions... do you think anyone has like tallied the amount of money illegal immigrants pay federally Do you think there s a chance that maybe they pay in more than they take out What about state taxes that are unavoidable
By backing Trump and allowing their false god to burn the country to the ground Republicans are admitting they want fewer Americans.
Yup.
I don't know how they don't call him out on this BS. They're doing themselves a collective disservice by not reinforcing each other's questions. If you want your questions to be taken seriously ensure he takes other's as seriously as you'd want yours.
It's tough not to argue china with their economy and population. China doesn't actively want to provoke us because we can fuck up their economy so they are playing the long game. Russia doesn't give a fuck so they'll take a shot when they can. Which is our biggest threat I guess it depends on the timeline you're giving yourself. At that very moment I guess russia was but if you dont keep an eye on China we're fools
I think that might be the most precise description I've read. And that is vitally important in not overstating the case. Now it's easy to say How do you overstate how bad Trump is And my response is really easily. His antipathy is formidable and for us to elect an antipathy laden president is deeply upsetting. And we've come to rely on on a president who if he doesn't care has the shame to hide it. I think Bush cared. Eventually. And sometimes. But you at least got the feeling he did. Cheney Not so much. But he's not the president. And so if you have a president ruled by his active disinterest and who amplifies that when speaking in public it's an incredible thing to realize you mean nothing. We mean nothing. I'm just outside Seattle our traffic is generally a shitshow. We got started on public transportation about 25 years late. Now There's no traffic. I went out at 11 30am today. There are some cars sure. But.. people are freaked out. My friend Bobby is.. so scared to go out. He's got a young son. Kid had a scare six months ago fever spiked to 102. 5 or so. He was a wreck. Wants to start growing potatoes. Afraid to go out and get planters. I'd love if we had a president who gave a shit about his son. Our sons our daughters our friends and loved ones. I remember feeling like that not that long ago. Until the tan suit. I'm lying Obama pulled that shit off.
It wouldn t make much of a difference though. It s not the only mill that can produce pulp. And with the power trump has he could just make mills in the states produce pulp for masks.

I had a brief flirtation with conservatism before the 2016 election. Let's just say this there's a gulf of a difference between theorizing about individual liberty reading Milton Friedman and listening to Thomas Sowell YouTube clips and the practical reality of governance. America does not have a conservative party. And when you look at the historical record of republican elected officials the evidence is fairly bleak. Thankfully I was a never Trump conservative and watching the Republican party line up to support Trump was a sobering wake up call for me.

So far hydroxychloroquine hasn t even been nearly as effective in my experience.

Elections are about compromise. I want a Bernie presidency but he's just not going to win the Primary. Anyone voting 3rd party or abstaining from voting is incomprehensibly stupid selfish and petty. It's the ugly truth but we will have to compromise on Biden. The alternative is so so much worse. 4 more years of Trump means at best the next 60 70 years will never ever see a progressive policy passed. At worse we descend into a fascist dictatorship where we are ruled by these sick inhuman idiotic ghouls.

Without intervention this disease could kill hundreds of thousands to millions of US citizens.

So basically got mine so fuck everyone else. Got it. In no place in the world should it cost 20 000 dollars to have a baby or go bankrupt because they broke their leg insurance or not. If you cant see that theres no saving you. Over 50 of the bankruptcy in America is over medical debt. Literally every other first world country even most second and some third have figured out healthcare should be provided. America is so far behind here its embarrassing. The stubbornness to hold on to a broken system is baffling
In the briefing they just had were the admiral was called in they said exactly this. They are delivering product to end point retailers where then they are placed for sale to the highest bidder.

I know this isn t the point that the article is making but this is exactly how countries you d think would be allies until the end go to war with each other. When climate change gets to the point where countries have thousands of refugees at their borders water becomes a scarcity to some nations and global wealth disparity is even broader than today this is how resource wars will begin. The petty withholding of some precious supplies will escalate to war. We don t want nationalists and strongmen in charge when we become a post abundance society. We need people who are willing to come together to solve problems. This dilemma trickles down all the way to who you elect as mayor.

I'm not blaming NYC for anything I'm just saying the world doesn't revolve around them. 8 isn't insignificant but that's not even 1 10th of the total GDP.

The pandemic is a national security threat. It is supposed to be handled by the federal government. The senators were given the duty of an impeachment trial. The Trump administration is the one that was distracted because it was there job to handle national security threats during that trial. Of course New York needed more than other states they have one of the if not the highest population density in the country. These letters absolutely will be a favorite of presidential scholars not for the reasons you think but because it is a disgusting way to handle a national crisis by someone who is more obsessed with his own ego and reelection rather than saving American lives.
If you shout bomb it is clearly with the intention of of causing this panic. But I agree it's a good example. Let me give you a in my mind better example. Slander. Is it a basic human right not to have your reputation damaged by lies
Nothing else What about remdesivir favipiravir and ritonavir Like hydroxychloroquine these are in phase 3 clinical trials to determine their efficacy against covid 19. More data needs to be gathered before dosing hundreds of thousands of people. Doctors are free to prescribe FDA approved drugs for off label uses if they feel it is the best course of treatment available.
The way you worded that was with the intent to imply that more people are active voters than residents of the state. Intent to imply fraud. The article suggests no such thing.
This is what total incompetence mixed with no moral compass begets.

He is a Democratic party aligned professional liar OF COURSE HE IS LYING The Democratic Party have been on display incessantly for four years demonstrating that they have ZERO concern for the rule of law due process honesty ethics individual rights or the welfare of the country as a whole Anyone who is aware of the events in this country for the past four years who is not diagnosed as mentally deficient or permanently high has no excuse you vote Democrat this election cycle NO MATTER WHOM THAT CANDIDATE IS AT THIS POINT and no matter which race congressional Presidential local you are in fact acting to further forces which seek to destroy the United States of America in sum a TRAITOR. I am NOT a partisan person. I detest partisanism. I voted for Billy and I even voted for Barack once My convictions have to do with America and the preservation of its core values and founding principles. The Democratic Party has demonstrated during the past four years that they care NOTHING For America or the preservation of its core values and founding principles. We need them to suffer at the ballot box like never before and slink away in defeat and reconsider their self destructive agenda reform or split off a new party that doesn't rest on the destruction of core American values as its primary means to exert its influence. I'm talking about the efforts by the Democratic party to overthrow the results of the 2016 election by myriad means all of them duplicitous and unethical if not also illegal. I'm talking about a party which cares more about its grip on power than on the core values and principles which are the bedrock of our American society. I'm talking about a movement intent on denying Americans due process under guise of hate crimes progressive values and political correctness. I'm talking about Communist totalitarian values disguised as benign social welfare and intended as a means to pander to the disadvantaged. I'm talking about a scheme to shift the demographics of as many states as possible so as to reconfigure the distribution of seats in the House and rig legislative processes for generations. I'm talking about a party which regards minorities as either useful idiots who can be bought with bread and circuses or even worse actually believes the nonsense about them being deficient incapable individuals in need of extra protection from the Nanny State on which so much of their rhetoric hinges. That is what I'm talking about for starters but it certainly is not the full extent of the un American traitorous despicable egregiously malfeasant agendas behaviors and habits of the so called Democratic party by a long shot. A full accounting of the wrongs they have engaged in these past 4 years nay these past 20 years would fill volumes. If you are not familiar with these patterns of behavior in the so called Democratic party these past few years then you are either delusional mentally incapacitated or part of the problem.

gt How will Bidens place differ significantly from Germany Biden wants a public option where people have the option of buying into a government run plan which is funded through a combination of taxes paid by everyone premiums monthly payments and some copays. Germany is kind of like that...but also kind of the opposite. There everyone making under a certain threshold has to be on a public plan. Unless you make 60 750 or more a year or are self employed you have to be on this this is the first major difference from Biden's plan There are a couple of different plans which are run by government affiliated non profit companies this is the second major difference Biden's would be run by the government itself Premiums are set by the German government and are mostly based on salary funded by equal employee and employer contributions like Social Security and Medicare in the US There are copays for things like drugs and hospital stays but these are well below US averages e.g 10ish day Deductibles vary from plan to plan. The public insurance plans are actually quite comprehensive they even cover basic dental vision and most prescription drug costs minus copays which even many countries with single payer systems don't But let's say you make over 60 750 a year. Here you get an option you can either choose a public plan or you can go with private insurance. These insurance companies have a set of requirements they have to meet but by and large work very similarly to healthcare plans in the US you have varying levels of coverage better plans cost more it's cheaper when you're younger but way more expensive as you get older people with preexisting conditions pay more or just straight up get refused etc. Unlike in the US the plan isn't done through your employer however as with public insurance your employer still pays half your premium if you have one For people making over 60 750 the German program is similar to what Biden is proposing... similar being the operative word. It's worth pointing out that a majority of Germans who can buy private insurance still choose to stick with the public plans. Part of this is due to risk once you get onto a private plan it's hard to go back to the public ones even if your income drops below 60 750 this is yet another difference between the German plan and Biden's Part of this is due to cost public insurance is usually cheaper unless you're a young healthy individual and even then you better save for when you get older Part is due to ease of access it's a lot easier to just go on one of the public plans than shop around for insurance And while the level of care might not be quite as good as thee private insurance plans the public insurance is good enough for the vast majority of people. There are also additional insurance programs provided by employers but those pretty much only cover work related injuries. It's a good way to incentivize employers to keep working conditions safe so they don't have to pay for medical bills while also saving the government some money. I don't actually know of a country off my head that does it like Joe Biden's plan. There's a number of ways different countries have achieved universal healthcare from single payer systems to systems with options to systems where the government provides everyone with healthcare but only covers say 70 of the costs usually people in these countries will buy insurance to cover the rest a bit like Medicare in the US to...whatever Switzerland does it's an almost entirely privatized system that still manages to be universal America going off on its own wouldn't be unusual since most countries have different variations of the same goal get everyone covered. On a personal note I usually prefer the German model over Biden's plan. Having the insurance provided by heavily regulated government affiliated non profit companies keeps costs down without putting peoples coverage at risk. However I do like how Biden would let anyone who wants to opt for private insurance. I don't think that would make a huge difference remember even among Germans who can afford to do so most don't take the private option but would probably make it go over better with voters people don't like the government forcing them to do things and having an option just for the well off risks alienating the working class Still I can understand Germany's reluctance to open it to everyone considering how expensive it can be and having more people on the public plans helps protect them from...shall we say... sabotage by nefarious political parties. Not naming any names.
he's late to the party. trump already gave everyone on unemployment 2400 month on top of a one time 1200 check
This is exactly right. The funny thing was... He gave his word theyd give them cash in replacememt for the ventilators as a repayment. Haha. Thats not good enough. Its like stealing the candy bar with the golden ticket from charlie and then buying him a different chocolate bar. Upstate New York will never see those ventilators again and its insane that a govenor is going to do this.... It wouldnt surprise me if national guardsmen and women refuse to do this.
I'm happy to hear that Biden and Sanders are now moving forward on candidacy and election plans including vetting vp potentials. Looks like positive mature growth promotive behavior and we need more that in politics. But even more than that if I had my hat in this ring I'd be announcing that my team was talking with every governor that I had election crews working in and finding out how to coordinate my election teams and citizens networks to start making plans on how to address American citizen survival in the face of coronavirus pandemic horrors followed immediately by economical collapse horrors. A lot of people are worried about May's rent already. And concurrently worried about food and basic needs logistics. And if they're not worried about either they need to be. Soon. Toilet paper and water are unavailable in stores mostly. I noticed personally that flour and sugar are also minimally in stores. Staples are about to become limited. So yeah have a team looking at vetting your vp options. But both Joe and Bernie need to start yelling out loud their plans to assist every American will have a home food shelter warmth and fun for free for a time. Because if Bernie and Joe don't then very soon a large percentage of Americans will follow the candidate who does promise those things. And that candidate currently who has no qualms about lying to people and promising them perfect magical positive hopeful dreams in a time of face melting horror is Trump. Plus focusing on the hard work of logistics and survival is the right thing to do right now too. And I'm not hearing a lot of taking charge announcements by either candidate and I believe at a time like this official legitimacy in trying to solve problems is about to be trumped by true skill in resolving problems. I hope the downvotes to this post are more valid and correct than I am. It means I'm overreacting to what I think is about to become the worst event the United States has ever had to try and survive and live through. And I do believe that.
Guess I am still rattled by the phone conversation. Was trying to joke with you but my part is just not funny.

Yeah on 12 16 on paper sure. Who s here worked on a farm before Haha
Because leftists are advocates and experts on state's rights when it suits them. And they never think the constitutionality of government action is ever in question
Lol
Haaaa and Democrats are cronies. Just have to say 2 names..bill and Hillary
I understand what Trump means by our stockpile and as long as he can expedite deliveries of the items to the states im okay with it. There are a lot of other things he s doing wrong but not providing the states with the items so that they can stockpile it is not one of them. Now If NY for example says we are out of ventilators If we don t get them tomorrow people will die and Trump sits on them then add it to the list.
We are at the mercy of morons and grifters who in their rush to destroy the US government to profit therefrom are facilitating the deaths of thousands of Americans instead of preventing them. Trump and his GOP crime syndicate must face criminal prosecution for their crimes against the American people.
They misspelled mismanagement
Biden is Trumps even dumber twin brother. Fuck out of here with that.
Ironic statement from a conservative. Considering the crimes trump ACTUALLY committed. Luckily for you his frat boys covered it up for him
Umm... what I have absolutely no clue what angle You re coming from on this one.
Nice bait chapo nerd get out.
Nancy Pelosi is the worst thing possible for this country. It's always politics with her but she is useless at it she needs to leave government. But she would never do what is good for America over what is good for her.
Can you even read I said compare. Nice armchair warrior logical takedown tho.
Because Desantis lips are the first ones sewn to Trump s ass in the sycophant centipede.
I'm no fan but the article doesn't mention Trump. The title of this is wrong.
Trump doesn t want you to have the right to vote He d rather you die than vote some leftist redditor probably
What are some of the other actions Remember when he told the CNN reporter he could cause way more chaos
Lololololol you mean are there subreddits

Do you care to elaborate on what led you to the conclusion that NYC is a shit hole as far as quality of life goes

I just threw in some awful thing Trump said a few weeks ago.
Took a two week CA vacation back in the fall. Theme parks national parks great restaurants etc. It was an awesome trip. But other than seeing Alcatraz San Fran smelled terrible was dirty and made us regret not spending more time at Yosemite. Having travelled there about 12 years ago I don t remember it being that bad at the time.
If you ban death no one will die anymore

Preventing supplies from being used to make essential medical gear and preventing nurses from helping people who need aid essentially condemning them to die. Cutting off power so ventilators and hospital equipment stop working causing innocent people to die. All of the above have been parroted by Canadians in r Canada and throughout reddit. These things unnecessarily put peoples lives at risks and condemn others to death. Is that okay with you I understand Trump is a damn retard I didn't vote for him and nobody I know did either. You think Canadians have it bad Try being an American who didn't vote for his dumbass. Not only do we have to fight amongst ourselves but now every other country is clumping us as one and the people in the US who despise Trump have to get shit on by not only his supporters in the US but the rest of the world. The frustration that any other country has with the US is far surpassed by those of us stuck in this damn nightmare ourselves. All I'm saying is the thinly veiled threats are fucking trash and you're going to make an entire country pay for something the POTUS said. In response to all the Canadian retaliation comments you can bet I'll propose a comeback and why wouldn't I use the most devastating form of retaliation as an example It completely shuts down any attempt at argument. You can't retaliate any harder than absolute destruction. If that disturbs you then that was the intention. Do two wrongs make a right If your answer is no then maybe you should talk to the Canadians who are proposing scenarios that hurt innocent people.
That would just be cutting their nose of to spite their face unless they are able to produce their own in which case they don t need ours anyway. I wasn t saying we d never export them just not while we have such a shortage that we re still telling non healthcare workers not to use any. There s a reason adults are told to secure their own oxygen masks on planes before assisting others.
Its not about the previous election you have to understand that this guy isnt listening to the professionals that have been through prior pandemics. Its not a dem vs. rep battle its literally trump vs. everyone else that takes covid seriously.

This isn't illegal... nothing will happen until it's literally against the law. Hilary deleting emails. Trump colluding with Russia which I don't think happened but if he did it's not against the law Pelosi making millions of stock. Burr not losing money by selling. The list goes on...
Never said should Don t get mad at me because I understand how things already are.
Oh right and it's perfectly fine for Canadians to talk about actions that will result in innocent people dying. Did you read my post at all or are you just holding Canadians to a different standard Fucking please.

I am watching a video right now that says that China ordered 200 000 body bags from Taiwan and is expecting food shortages as people are panic buying rice flour and emptying grocery stores.
I can't speak for him directly but it comes and goes in waves that's what it did for me anyway. It also really spikes your blood sugar sky high even when fasting so you have literally no appetite while you burn off a ton of calories. I'm still in isolation from my family and so I haven't been able to weigh myself but looking in the mirror I've lost a significant amount of weight. Talking to other people who have tested positive they seem to be losing between one and three pounds per day. just as devil's advocate it's also possible that he's very dehydrated and that would explain for some of the additional weight loss. He very well may be lying I have no idea but what he's describing for symptoms as well as the weight loss does not sound inconceivable to me having just recovered from coronavirus... Well almost recovered.
The longer these exemptions are allowed the longer everyone must stay quarantined. These exemptions only push off the day that these stay at home advisories must remain.
I never understood those states whose main concern when voting during the Primary was Healthcare and Social Security and yet voted for Biden an enigma that will have me questioning the sanity of the electorate for years to come.
gt On the scale of Flu lt gt Ebola this is closer to the flu. A linear scale comparing viruses with drastically different spreading mechanisms and severity of symptoms is a waste of time. Covid 19 spreads far more easily than ebola and despite having a far lower death rate it has the propensity to affect a far larger number of people. It's also pretty clear by now that it is worse than a regular flu.

If by a certain type of person you mean anyone with any pre existing health condition like diabetes or lung heart problems anyone who s obese anyone who has an alcohol or drug problem and anyone who is perfectly heathy but over the age of 40 50 then yeah it only affects a certain kind of person. Even if you re a healthy 25 year old you can very well be hospitalized and permanently lose 20 30 of respiratory function. Most people don t realize how bad it is and that s why they aren t listening and not quarantining themselves. That s why a forced quarantine is being talked about.

I can tell you're not a veteran because this has absolutely happened. I had junior enlisted and NCOs do this same thing on convoys when we first got overseas and nothing was happening.
Actually I wasn t defending OP I was criticizing your idiotic statement and btw pretty sure the only insane one here is you.
Me I voted for the winning party last year. Reporter But the Democrats lost. Me Yeah. I knew the Republicans were going to win so I voted for them...during the primaries. Reporter But you didn't drop out until after all the primaries were done. Me You should have seen the look of shock on the face of the dude who handed me my ballot.
And yet the MSM is more worried about Trump's lies. China is literally killing its own people and no one cares.
Not to go all conspiracy theorist here but I've read about meeting between billionaires and security companies to discuss how they would maintain control over the security team if the concept of money disappeared in an apocalyptic setting. Like shock collars rationing food from private storage to compliant people etc. It's a fascinating scenario to think about even though it's so morbid.

Well as an agnostic I must say you bring up some good points. With this quarantine locking me in my home I should have some time to do some research on that. It was good talking to you and I hope you have a good night.
You don t do a distraction at midnight on a Friday. The pandemic is the distraction this is what he s really interested in.
Anyone criticizing this move is living in a bubble sheltered from the reality of this disease. The doctors nurses med techs and hospital staff who have to go in everyday and treat the patients who knock on death s door are heroes. They risk their lives every minute of every day. They are literally dying left and right. Without PPE to protect these individuals they might as well sign their own death certificate. They act with such selflessness. President Trump is completely within his scope to keep those masks for US health professionals and I m thankful that the brave men and women on the front lines have someone who s not afraid of the blowback in order to provide them with what they need. I don t care if this gets downvoted. Just remember in 2 weeks it could easily be you or your significant other or one of your parents in a hospital bed trying to beat this. You ll be rejoicing that Trump kept American made resources here so it s still possible to receive necessary treatment.
Wasn't that the vp's job
Suuuuuch a shitty post. Lmao
Austin yes. The very hearts of Dallas and Houston too. Basing all of this anecdotally but San Antonio amazingly has many Trump supporters and the suburbs of all the major cities lean Christian Right Wing.
I saved us from a nuclear war with Iran
I'm getting deeply skeptical over almost everything people are saying about this bug even the federal government. Nobody seems to be blood testing the population to find out how many people have already been exposed try and pin down the timeline and how much further it has to go. People keep saying that if we lift the lockdown too soon we risk a second spike but if we don't know population exposure rates rather than just confirmed cases we're shooting in the dark. I've seen YT videos of people going into New York hospitals and they're empty. Talking to paramedics and they're saying they see maybe 3 cases in a day and even then they're not sure. The people who die seem to invariably either the old and sick or people pre made for media cherry picking. What if this is just like every other pandemic scare where the virus is mostly harmless unless you're already sick What if most of the population has already been exposed to the virus and didn't even develop symptoms What if all this lockdown bullshit is politically motivated and driven by fake news and a cycle of hysteria Notice how the only people really buying into this stuff are people who watch the fake news and those people repeat the talking points almost robotically and call out people on social media Everyone else is going along to get along and waiting for this to end. Notice how it's only been a few weeks and the economic cost is becoming clear while the human cost is looking horribly exaggerated It wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if people started calling bullshit on this whole thing very very soon. The very things we need to know are the things nobody seems very interested in and yet are totally possible for us to find out. Why did CBS need to use footage from Italy when they could have just sent one guy with a camera down to a New York hospital
I could come up a bunch of not impossible Tom Clancy plots too. The bats are good enough on their own in weaponizing viruses. Evil actors don't have to put in all the resources for that they just have to wait.
We also modified a website to correct Jared's mistake instead of responding to the pandemic.
it s not just bad it s unbearable. i think it s much better to terminate a group of some cells that isn t even sentient than to put a kid through such a bad life that they just end up committing suicide.
this sounds like something a nazi would say
Shit they're noticing lack of coverage sucks.
And opening facebook this am I have 3 different moderate Democrats' cheering for the downfall of our economy wishing death upon Republicans and incarceration for trump and his family without even having to scroll down. Their feedback is overwhelmingly supportive. I think politics is an accurate representation of the party as it is today.
If no one starves and no one is denied medical treatment as you say I'm good to go That's enough for me.

I didn't say he's definitely an idiot. I said he sounds like an idiot. What that says about me is that I don't have confidence in people that sound like idiots. I'm ok with that. And ya it is entirely possible for man with Trump's history to be an idiot. One of the indicators that would tell me that is how he talks and what he talks about.
i mean its going to be bad we will have a few million dead here at best all said and done. Hell i might even be one of the dead but fact is we have shit to get done and a country to keep afloat if me laying down my life keeps shit afloat so be it. Better men have died for less in worse conditions to keep their nations afloat.

The president is the head of the Federal Government he can lock down the country's foreign borders. But he cannot mandate a nationwide stay at home Individual State Governments can. But even then there must be sufficient proof to do so and it cannot be indefinite.
This is legally a constitutional crisis FYI. I wish we could have a vote of no confidence for the president but it simply isn't in the law of the land.
Wasn't it the right saying that the cure cannot be worse than the disease This isn't a magic cure all. Renal failure is a very real risk from this drug.

How can you possibly say the media is exaggerating the virus Have you not looked at the data
How can I help
I'm confused. Is this implying that people should still be working in these conditions
wow dude you brought up south afrika white drivers to argue for your point on a American constitutional right pretty based
It doesn't help anyone though the migrants take the money out of the US economy and US workers get shafted while having their wages dragged artificially down. Unfortunately businesses take every opportunity they can to cut costs and labor is a big one which is why rules have to be in place to protect people. I 100 agree with your 3rd paragraph and its one of my biggest issues with the kind of bootstrap language we see coming from the right. Big business has captured the government they have figured out how to privatize the gains screwing over regular citizens and migrant workers while socializing their losses and demonizing the poor workers and whatever other scapegoat they can find. I hope this pandemic will at least result in workers receiving more protections better wages and the dignity to live their lives freely. Markets are intended to work for everyone maybe we will start seeing that in our lifetime.
Eh I'm in a super rural area. I think we have like 7 cases so far in our whole county. It's mostly just going through the motions. It's the guys in the urban areas that are getting it bad right now.
People should have voted for Adam Laxalt Fuck these Californians moving to Nevada and voting for guys like this smh
Of course he does. Bow down or be gone.
Biden has made a larger impact on same sex marriage than Bernie. That's the point. Saying that Bernie has dragged the party when his views were not that different than the norm is wrong. It's one example but a glaring example where Bernie gets credit for things he didn't do. Before 2015 he had basically zero impact on national politics
Douche. Bag.
Except he isn t in the ICU.
Yeah I ll delete it
Between this and trump gutting the unemployment seems the Dems didn t reach far enough again.
all outrage all the time
Remember when Obama got other world leaders threatening retaliation for something he's done Blaming them so he can deflect attention from his shortcomings and poor response to a health crisis like SARS epidemic Or Causing unnecessary supply or production delays shortages Me neither.
Haha love the Dune reference But I think it gives Donald and Jared entirely too much credit even when we specify that it s stupid fan fiction
It s more like you bought the car and didn t do an oil change for 3 years and are angry that the engine stopped working.
Anyone I could potentially infect is also running the risk b c they are out and about as well. If they go on to spread it to a 3rd party are they a victim or a criminal
If any church is open during this I'd quit going and bash them honestly. The Bible has rules about sickly being in congregations and quarantines. We don't know who's sick and it's not instant so follow these biblical teachings. But I guess you gotta read last the tithing and John 3 16 verse long enough to realize that. I'm 100 religious too but if you claim to live the Bible follow it.
None of those states have bans on chloroquine. They've restricted outpatient prescriptions to avoid people stockpiling the drug. New York had it so only approved FDA treatments or COVID 19 patients that were part of a clinical trial could get the drug and that was amended soon after. Plus the FDA approved emergency off label prescriptions so that part of the restricted ended up not meaning anything. Michigan never passed anything they just gave out a recommendation to limit prescriptions to avoid people stockpiling the drug.
Well. There are laws against appointing family members to cabinet positions. This lil twerp has been appointed to a made up role that shouldn t be able to override senate appointed cabinet members but Trump has anointed this ass clown with all of the powers of the president.

He has tested negative and his wife is now fully recovered although they are still in quarantine although less strict. Why would Trudeau point his anger at China for an issue he has with the states. Your logic does not make any sense
This thread gives me hope for this sub.
No. Since 2016 Trump has been self inflicting the US.
You're talking to the Trump admin right
It's a criminal enterprise not a political party.
Expanding the franchise and allowing more Americans to vote sounds like something America should aspire to.
No. National emergencies change things.
Yes
and to point out those motives would make one a racist. At least I've been told that is today's definition of one.
That sounds like this 13yr old kid I know.
This is why Trump never has press briefings or very rarely. His advisers know he is likely going to over react to something and showcase how poorly he is able to lead. Unfortunately for them this outbreak demands these daily briefings so the world can get more of the real Trump almost every day.
Don t worry The corporate wing of the democratic party wants us to get creepy hands uncle Biden in against trump Vote for the rapist you agree with more

You do realize private ownership doesn't mean EVERYTHING has to be privately owned right Neither does supporting free enterprise mean that everything is part of the free market Free enterprise is defined as gt free en ter prise fr en t r pr z noun gt gt an economic system in which private business operates in competition and largely free of state control. See two can play at that game. Largely doesn't mean Completely amp x200B gt And no the government does not have a monopoly on violence. That s what the 2nd Amendment literally is about. I very specifically addressed exactly that if you read my post again. If you think that government can't intrude on civil liberties in order to ensure collective safety I don't really know what to say go to r Libertarian Because they routinely do that and have been since the founding. Your idealized idea of conservatism is called libertarianism While conservative ideals such as free enterprise and private ownership are encouraged and supported by the government the united states is NOT a libertairan utopia

I mean Universal Healthcare works quite well for taxpayers in every other first world country with many paying the same level of taxes. If you view the health of individual consumers as an investment it pays off in the long term for society. More healthy workers more production innovation. Same goes for education and quality of the goods and services in the market.

Normal Now that you ask it sure does seem alil worshippy. It is absolutely required In all military units. The whole chain of command from President down to company boss was supposed to be displayed. Always about 10 15 pics. Also usually the first thing you see when you walk in. I do remember seeing Arnold pics up in government places in Cali when I used to live there. I m sure that s probably required at the state level. Now that I m out of the military I don t noticed the pics anymore so I can t say if Tennessee past and my current state did does it. I think I know the answer but is this not a thing in Canada If it was would it be just Justin or the Queen or something
Imagine 3 years into Obama s presidency we were still kn a recession and he blamed bush don t need to imagine. That happened.
It was emptier than it should have been though but not because of Obama gt the Obama administration tried to replenish the stockpile in 2011 by asking Congress to provide 655 million but That was rejected by the Republican House. The new House majority was intent on curbing government spending especially at HHS which administered Obamacare. propublica.org
In fection. New Zombie.
It s a disingenuous argument. Deflection of the fact the big orange reality tv host completely mishandled the situation. Intentionally more than likely so the proper stocks could have time to be sold and bought.
totally true youtu.be
Decent fact check though they spent a decent amount of their article talking about Trump which isn't really relevant to the fact being checked. I guess it let us know that the supplies were indeed lacking in recent times.

Such a shitpost. OP is from our favorite shitposting site. While the article does say there are lots of things in storage NONE of them are needed for this virus and for the treatment of those who have its symptoms. I'll make an edit with a quote from the article proving my point. gt The inventory includes millions of doses of vaccines against bioterrorism agents like smallpox antivirals in case of a deadly flu pandemic medicines used to treat radiation sickness and burns chemical agent antidotes wound care supplies IV fluids and antibiotics. But once you get down far enough into the article it actually does support exactly what Trump was referencing. gt It s true that some of the supplies in the stockpile that governors are currently asking the government to send to states were not completely restocked during Obama s presidency. gt For example the Washington Post reported on March 10 that the reserves of the N95 respirator masks were not significantly restored after tens of millions of the devices were distributed from the stockpile during the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009. Edit added the quote about what the inventory includes.

Absolutely destroyed our standing in foreign policy for so long. It's a global community now which people dont grasp. In 1920 it took nearly a month to get to Australia.

Stop wishing ill will because like it or not he is our president. Maybe he'll prove us all wrong. It leaves a knot in my stomach to think of where we are going to be when this is over. It saddens me how people still don't see his ineptitude.

Acting sanctimonious because you don't know any hardships I've gone through previously doesn't help the situation. You're not the only person who has gone through hard times so start acting like it honestly.

That's because it's true. If you pay your taxes it's one less you can be arrested for and all evidence suggests that illegal immigrants pay their taxes at a much higher rate than the average american. It's just a fact.

And they re writing articles saying as much. And you seem to think that is wrong. What is factually wrong in this article that would support your distaste of this group. Or do you just not like them because they re pointing out trumps failings.

they're not your resources until you receive them and pay for them. when they're manufactured in america by an american company they're american until the transaction. the american government has the right to seize these products to save american lives just like the canadian government has the right to seize the raw resources to produce product in their own country. The Priorities Authority Title III authorizes the president to ensure the timely availability of critical materials equipment and services produced in the private market by requiring businesses to accept and prioritize contracts mandated by the government But the government must still pay market value for the performance of those contracts s thehill.com 3M can probably sue the government if they paid less than the canadian contract but they can't sue over the seizure itself. it's a lawful action to save american lives

Tax revenue would increase due to higher wages and localities would benefit property values would increase in these small towns.

Though the market would ultimately determine wages so long as that market no longer includes the labor of illegals.
I agree its not on him to propose a solution. Furthermore I agree the cure should not be worse than the disease. But as it stands currently the disease burden right now has extremely damaging potential given how early of a stage we are in at this time. My point was only that for those who criticize the current solution there is added credibility when one can actually propose a viable alternative. Anyone can complain that the economy is really suffering and I agree its a pretty tough situation on so many fronts. But alternative solutions are fairly limited leading me to conclude that we should continue with widespread social distancing at present until we can find an alternative.

So you are talking about the lack of health and mental health services to the underprivileged communities. The forbes estimate is 500 000 people died due to lack of adequate access to care for cancer treatment while Obamacare may have it's flaws it has gotten many underinsured people insurance as well as expanded medicaid and medicare massively. This includes for mental health services. On top of that if you watched the Trump presser today there were funds of a 100bil meant to specifically cover the uninsured population during this time of crisis. Regardless what you think of the current administration these issues are being addressed. The suicide estimate is 10000 people killed themselves due to the 2008 financial. It is entirely believable that this is the case but mental health care access has improved over the last decade. I know its fucking bleak but there is some bright spots.

Being forced to stay in your home is absolutely a restriction of your basic rights. Most people understand that it's for the greater good so we'll go along with it but don't even pretend it's not a major infringement.
I think there is one one important aspect you are not considering. The initial mortality rate is not going to stay that way. As far as we know the hospilitation rate to intensive care is between 2 and 6 while the average stay seems to be 14 days. This leads to rapidly filling up intensive care capacity and continuously so. Going over it is going to be ugly. Going 10x or later even 30x over capacity is going to be an absolute gruesome shitshow of hordes of people dying in hospital corridors and at home that could have been saved. Think Italy but much much worse. At least that is what we are concerned with in Germany. And we have a very solid healthcare system with socialist' insurance for everyone. Might be interesting to you

But in terms of contagion it is much more contagious than Ebola. In a way being less lethal to most has made it a greater threat to all carriers with no to little symptoms don't know they are sick.

When I see groups of church goers or lake visitors on the news I know this isn't taken seriously. The state government has rights in this emergency to police and protect people.

It's a state by state issue. Washington State has mail in voting. Each resident is mailed a ballot and an envelope to return it in that has been prepaid postage. You are mailed a ballot pamphlet which has the candidates their profiles and official statements and a list of the issues. There is a pro argument for the issue and a against argument for the issue. Each argument is provided by the group pushing for the initiative or defending against the initiative. The voter is given 2 3 weeks to mail in their ballot or to drop it off at a designated voting station. It's actually pretty easy and there hasn't been much if any controversy over fraud despite some close elections. amp x200B Other states are free to design their own process.

I did read it it s a pointless op Ed about a guy from Philly who lives in Brooklyn that is merely making a vague statement with no legitimate reasons why other states should somehow suffer economically. But nowhere in the article does he explain why they re somehow uniquely immune from a highly contagious outbreak which when it infects a community will overwhelm local hospitals quickly. Why are we unnecessarily putting workers healthcare facilities vulnerable populations and pretty much everyone in harm s way for no reason His reason is well what s the point of living if we all have to suffer economically Because no one can afford to. Do you think restaurants are gonna suddenly open when people are going to just avoid them because they know there s a highly contagious virus being spread in their own community If no one is going to come out for dinner why is a restaurant going to buy food and pay workers to sit on shift Here s the answer there isn t fucking one. This isn t going away soon and willing it away with some delusional logic is just going to kill more people. You know the crazy part about being in Manhattan now You wouldn t think anything was going on cause people are actually staying home. Go to a hospital floor and we re being overwhelmed by patients. This could be ANY hospital in the entire country. And they don t have the trained staff to handle a crisis.

he can't have rallies b c covid. so he's trying to make these his new rallies except only 45 of america will tolerate his fucking rallies.
You re pretty much describing the US Senate.
You might want to work on your reading comprehension. Thomas Modly the acting secretary of the Navy accused Capt. Brett Crozier of having poor judgment for using a non secure unclassified email address to write an email to his immediate chain of command which also included 20 or 30 additional recipients. Motherfucker used Yahoo Mail to blast 20 or 30 randos and you wanna blame the leaker Please.
She's actually been saying she wants to divorce him since I believe 2001 and was arrested and charged with domestic abuse after attacking him. I mean innocent until proven guilty but if it walks and quacks like a duck...
The need is dire in America. Yesterday 1321 Americans died. Canada lost thirty five people. Sorry. I would not allow the export of masks until a state isn't losing 19x the number of people that Canada is losing every single day.

But it's shitty that the majority of articles in this sub are opinion pieces instead of straight facts.
Nooooooooooooooooooo
Feeling the same. It s infuriating being so helpless. It feels like we re sliding into a fascist dictator state where truth doesn t matter because these fucks have so many people hopped up on propaganda. He needs to go. He needs to go he is ruining this fucking country and his government doesn t care if we live or die and there s NOTHING we can do about it but hope and pray enough people can vote in November to get him out before it s too late.
at this point with the Fed printing 125 B day they will be bailing out the states eventually. moral hazard...
Yeah no kidding. Just the fact that he's even working in the White House is a fucking problem that they should have been excoriated for for years now it's the definition of corruption... but only now after three years it's a problem Fucker shouldn't even be there.
At the end of the day he s the best outcome from the previous election to handle this. Going forward I don t see much on the other side. Also not a republican.
The problem is your tolerance for risk unintentionally increases risk for those who have not chosen to take that risk. For example going to the gym someone might pick up the virus and then pass it on while at the grocery store a place everyone still needs to go regardless of risk.
As much as I appreciate the concept about newer generations outweighing older ones it still won't make things better for you. The belief system is in place where they think it will make things better for you and trying to generalize the concept by using generations will always fail because my generation thought the same things. My main issue is with young people pushing this belief system and thinking it will turn up roses and it will just bite them in the ass and they will continue to blame the generation before them for this fuck up because people keep using generation gap excuses. My personal favorite is trying to compare ours to theirs and not factoring in all of the cascade effects of our healthcare issues. Ahh well.
The Dems have had 2 out of the last 25 years to do things without the GOP getting in the way. Even if the claim was true it's a fucking brag about how obstructionist they've been. This is straight gas lighting. They stop anything from getting done by literally holding the economy hostage and then blame the Dems for not getting things done.
I don't want people to die or anything like that. I want to get back to before the coronavirus hit. I'm not saying we should sacrifice all these people just to bring Trump down. Definitely not. But for the sake of conversation drastic changes to countries really only happen from drastic events. Typically wars but a pandemic like this can cause the same change. That's all I was trying to bring tonight and question if this would do it.

You know nothing about me I am trying to have conversations with conservatives. I think it is a waste of time to only speak with people who have the same viewpoint as me. Is free speech not allowed on this sub I am asking legitimate questions looking for legitimate answers from conservatives on their thoughts on how this administration is handling the pandemic. If that is too much for you then I am sorry if I hurt your feelings. Thank you and stay healthy out there.
I can't wait for Jussie Smollett's coronavirus announcement. It's going to be so over the top dramatic. And a lie.
He need's to get up in that penthouse forum
Nope not what I said at all. Good job with the word twisting though. I said as a comparison the total number is irrelevant. Per capita comparisons are totally relevant and total numbers absent a comparison are also perfectly relevant. But when used as a comparison tool total numbers are obviously crafted to tell a certain biased story.
It really sounds like you just need to use some Lysol.

Disagree. The thing about food is there are many types. In economics there is a concept of a substitute goods. We already know that fruits and vegetables are expensive and low income people don t eat many of them. If we increase the cost of labor farmers will need to increase the cost of produce. Some people will pay the higher price and others will simply find something else to eat. In reality what I would expect is the market for produce to simply shrink to a new equilibrium point. Is that bad Not necessarily. However I don t think this can be viewed as taking American jobs.
No need for that pull yourself up by your bootstraps amigo. Where is your wealthy savings Have you tried some financial literacy classes Not the government's job to prop you up after all. Not sure why you are in such a panic here
How about having pride in your humanity and making the personal choice to keep things from getting worse That doesn't make you a slave to the government. You don't even have to factor the government into that decision. Instead of being selfless and chilled out you ALL act like snowflakes who don't need to be intelligent and just want to argue about everything. Throwing gibberish and political science labels and concepts around to inflate your own stupid egos like you want to stand on a pile of bodies just so people can hear you say how right you are about democracy socialism whatever other kind of dumbass system you use to elevate yourself over others. Everybody sucks. From the grocery lickers to the whiney dick heads who want everything done yesterday and don't want the same for your neighbor. You are all of you fucked from head to toe. That's why we're all gonna fuckin die. Fuck this dumbass planet.
Good so the lite made a mistake. So what
Once Trump and Kushner cleans up this mess exacerbated by the Obama administration hopefully by the end of April we ll be able to give all the doubters a big fat I told you do.
This is the wake up call I guess one of many at this point People thought foolishly that Trump would be corralled by the government experts by the GOP Congress the adults in the room. Instead we are continually reminded that the person called President has the power and a corrupt president will corrupt the government he controls.
Again you're saying all lives matter. You're not speaking to the more granular issues that happen amongst black people. You want black people to unionize when companies are still stuck in the 80s and discriminate heavily How can they unionize when they don't have jobs

I'm a Bernie supporter. Losing a fair fight to Biden is unfortunate in my opinion but it was fair. The animosity formed last time was under different circumstances and a different set of rules. Bidens not my first choice but I'll play ball with him.
gt Accordingly when calculating the illegal alien population FAIR includes adults and children without any immigration status as well as individuals who have received temporary reprieves through TPS DACA etc. So the report says this and that they include 4. 2 million children of illegal immigrants aka US citizens in their calculations. It even mentions that those children are a significant portion of the fiscal burden. I ll concede that my link may have not been unbiased but yours is also trying to make it sound as bad as possible. I just want to find clear data which is damn near impossible given we re working with estimates due to the nature of the topic so we could all make informed decisions about this.
Go be homeless for 6 months then report back how you feel about deaths vs homelessness. We are asking potentially 10 Americans to be homeless and hungry to save 1. This is the calculation. Why don t you try it out if it s so easy
Executive orders expire at the end of an administration unless signed again by the incoming executive. Most are allowed to expire. The reason the 9 11 era executive orders are still there is because terrorism is a nebulous idea rather than an actual foe and so can never truly be defeated therefore disincentivizing anyone from letting them expire. Go ahead and find me the official definition for what terrorism means and what our victory parameters are. COVID 19 on the other hand is a very tangible thing that can be defeated and those orders would no longer make sense to keep once this pandemic has run it s course.
Well in keeping with the fact that Trump never does anything that doesn't backfire we'll surely know everything she knows very soon.
The names are different and I'm in the U.S but you pretty much just described where I live. We aren't the cattle capital either I guess but I hear we have some pretty great meth so that's something.

Yes because people without pre existing conditions can get treatment and survive if they get really sick. If enough people get the survivable with treatment version of Covid the hospitals will get overloaded and these people will die too. That's what we are trying to prevent here.
yeah only now its our own law enforcement asking for papers for just being on the street.
Turnout is still going to be higher than 2016 huge drop off that year in the dem base as mentioned in the article but yes this coronavirus all things equal benefits the GOP because their base is more likely to turnout in spite of this virus threat. I am hoping McConnell is not forced to give in to her demands for vote by mail. That will benefit the dems a lot.
Conservative is a broad term. As is Communist If you're saying you wan't no government then you're an anarchist. If you're saying you want very minimal government then you're libertarian. Beyong that if you accept that a government has to exist then the question becomes to what extent the powers of the government are limited or checked. Now we arrive at Communist VS Conservative You can be socially conservative and fiscally progressive OR fiscally conservative and socially progressive. If I had to be more specific Communism bleeds into controlling the means of production means of information dissemination as well curtailing civil liberties ala China. The US government is more of a balance between civil liberties and collective rights i.e you'll be as free as possible as long as your freedom doesn't endanger the rights of the collective If it does the government will use its monopoly on violence to ensure that it specifically does NOT its why we have 2A as a check against that but thats another discussion entirely So while you're right in saying that nationalizing a private business is what communists do I would argue that its a communist Idea but controlling the means of production in exceptional circumstances is still very much American and not without historical precedent
Obama waited five months after the who declared it a pandemic before he declared a national emergency. Trump waited one week.. Trump's response has been far better than any other country. And the pandemics problems are a result of the Democrats failure of leadership and their botched handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Nancy pelosi was the one who was telling people it was safe to go out and see movie is all the way up to February 24th. Bill de Blasio was telling people to go outside all the way up until March. Andrew Cuomo shut down hospitals..
You aren't wrong. When it was a much smaller community it was an okish place to see news that wasn't so far to the left. But during the 2016 primaries I said that Trump would be the nominee not Cruz and they banned me saying a bigot like that would never lead the GOP
Are they worried not enough people will die and become Democrats
I think it was a silver plan. This isn t it exactly but it was something like it. The one she has had a lower premium as part of the exchange than what is listed here api.centene.com She hasn t paid for any doctors visits this year though one of her medications is like 40 even with the plan. But it was like 70 before so I don t think she s complaining.
Nice man. I assume there s a subsidy involved because she s low income. Obviously you don t have to get all the info but I read that plan and it looks pretty solid only thing is it s HMO style where you have to stay in network otherwise no coverage. There s also shit I m sure they d say wouldn t be covered that they re not up front about like medications and treatments in the hospital because insurance is just insurance. My brother had a plan like this and only things in network counted towards the 675 all others weren t covered so if you go to an out of network hospital because it s down the street it s full liability. Interesting that she hasn t had to pay for doctors visits etc. Insurance is weird.
Dude it feels so good to know someone else out there still has brain cells. Stay safe. From the virus and the crazies
Ordinances are usually city and county level laws not state. State laws are called laws
You are trying to some how put it on Trump that the issues weren't resolved. He is the only person in washington who fucking did anything about this outbreak from the beginning. Did he downplay it Of Course but what do you want him to do scream at the top of his lungs and get everybody in a panic. In a situation like this I understand wanting to say things to keep people as calm as long as possible.
I can speak from experience that the vast majority of poor trump supporters at least where I'm from simply don't know anything different than what they're told by their favorite media outlets and the orange man himself. My family lived on top of a mountain in West Virginia for like a century until they moved to a more urban environment. It's all they know.
The state does not have the right to disarm your basic rights of freedom of press religion gun ownership etc. in times or crisis. However they can make you not assemble in groups over 10 as we see today. Our country s formation was heavily influenced by James Locke s freedom of life liberty and property. He says that the reason why government was created was to protect those three rights. In contemporary times such as the Corona Virus a person assembling with more than 10 people or going to non essential places infringes other people s rights of life because that person is increasing the chance of spreading the disease. In this case the government can institute temporary laws to protect the lives of citizens. The government quarantining us is for our own good so that we may live. Very extreme Democrats today do not have the real right to implement major changes to society that fit their viewpoint because of just Corona Virus Also I think that OP doesn t mean that he can go outside without being restricted. I don t think he is trying to seem harmful

The problem though as seen by people refusing to stay at home partying at Spring break Mardi Gras parades is that there is a significant portion of the population that is too stupid to understand the science of a pandemic. It's exacerbated by the fact that some of these stupid people are governors currently there are 12 states without meaningful stay at home orders. It's extreme negligence bordering on the criminal. So how does a country deal with this Just throw up your hands and say oh well states rights and watch people die We are nowhere near the peak for numbers of infected and dead. This is going to get much worse.

Actually that s not true. Almost all hospitals in Canada are private although the majority of them are not for profit What we have is a single payer health care system. Essentially each province has their own insurance company that pays for everyone s medical care. They negotiate prices set quotas and standards etc. with all of the private health care entities in their respective province.
Do you get a free day off to visit the DMV on a normal occasion People take personal days hours to handle their business all the time. If you're not a jackass and give your boss a heads up it isn't a problem. When you text them an hour after you were supposed to be at work that's when you have a problem. I wonder if you did any research because the India ID is free of charge uidai.gov.in Being poor has no bearing on getting the ID. I do have an issue with making that singular number your identifying record in every database like happens with our SSNs. That's just wrong. But hey I agree if the feds want to mandate a singular ID then they should provide it of course we all pay for it later regardless Of course they would have to fight the states that think they have IDs handled and I don't really know how the courts would fall on that issue.
The only senators in the deserted chamber who witnessed his speech before he cast his vote were 3 Democrats 1 Republican another Republican presiding over the impeachment.

If McConnell thought that was a possibility the Republicans would have been in their seats with a glass of milk or water to glare at him.

gt Its almost like there are departments and agencies set up and filled with experts Well there used to be.
No. A lot of people are legitimately worried that if things got bad enough that say grocery stores and pharmacies closed people would start getting desperate just for food and medicartion meaning looting robbing etc. If someone believes that's a likely scenario it's not difficult to understand why they'd also want a gun to protect their family loved ones. Those types don't want to kill people they're just fearful and want to keep those around them safe. Now I think those people are misguided in that things likely won't get that bad in that sort of way. Countries with the virus haven't collapsed into anarchy. The absolute worst case scenario seems to be that a fuck ton of people die and the economy sucks not a total societal degradation collapse.
For what uses
Yeah its tricky many seasonal workers do rotate industries like farming and tourism. Honestly I know this sub is against it but just decoupling employment from healthcare would be huge. Removing a major burden from workers and employers. That farmer paying 18 an hour probably cant afford to offer healthcare most likely for those few months and those migrants definitely arent getting healthcare either. No one will lose the motivation to work and contribute just because they can now go to a family doctor in my opinion. I hope at the very least this pandemic shows the benefits of setting the minimum standard for all people a little bit higher. Every country dealing with this now doesn't have to solve the issue of how do we get people follow guidelines check in for testing and not fear ruining their life. If I was in a position of lose my job and healthcare I dont know if I could do that I'd be terrified what if I had a family member relying on some lifesaving drug

Yeah I don't know why this is so hard to understand. Science is all about caution and objectivity not rejecting OR approving of any one potential treatment based on political motive. Like it or not the journalists and people on the left discounting its effects are just as bad as the right overstating its effects without sufficient evidence. Even if it is effective or it's not both sides of the coin are wrong here and we will all be better off just stop politicizing it and just remain hopeful that it will work but absolutely not stop taking precautions on the premise that it won't Assume it won't
Wouldn't it be nice if everyone simultaneously stopped caring about what Trump says Just... reporters walk off camerman shrug and film real experts... just like that. We can can take this particular viper's power away by ripping out his tongue.

gt It s a bad decision optics wise one administration official said in the immediate aftermath. It politicizes people s access to health services during a serious national health emergency. gt If Trump had chosen instead to reopen the HealthCare.gov website as 11 largely blue states that control their own markets have already done people without insurance could buy more comprehensive policies that not only would cover coronavirus but any follow up treatment mental health care and future check ups. gt The White House decision also caught the hospital industry off guard frustrating executives who spent the past week awaiting guidance for how strained front line facilities could access the new funding.

This was from 2 weeks ago youtu.be t 84 EDIT Did you miss the part in the first example I gave where even in the new study he states We believe that other teams should urgently evaluate this therapeutic strategy Do you have a problem with this
omg please takeover the Midwest and northeast
Come on be smarter than that there are serious ramifications for a company complying with that order. We are talking about a free market economy and you re advocating for them to cripple their international business sales They source material from Canada and have factories all over the world what s the long term here not just the short term.
I hope I'm next week's chooser so I can pick a good Protestant for purposes of equilibrium.

gt But the minute a person is arrested for having a BBQ with a neighbor or a pastor is arrested for exercising his first amendment right to freedom of religion the government has gone too far. Banning religious gatherings would almost certainly be unconstitutional and the minute a state tried to enforce that with force the courts would step in. From every church I've seen mine included they made the voluntary church to suspend services and try to do some form of pre recorded seminars or virtual connection with the congregation. Hobby lobby already sounds like they have a court case going about not being allowed to operate questioning the definition of what an essential service is. For example why is a golf course considered essential but a hobby shop isn't I expect we will see many court cases if this thing drags on. Adjusting zoning or occupancy rules making changes to liquor or night club license that are well within the legal framework is one thing but indefinite shutdowns of not only private business but movement of people for a very broad public health crisis will be challenged especially when as I mentioned other businesses are allowed to operate.
Mic drop.
Breaking quarantine isn't the same as spreading the disease but it can be if you do any of the following Touch anything someone else may touch without disinfecting it. Breath at any surface which someone else might reasonably end up touching. Spend any amount of time breathing in a poorly ventilated cramped area with other people. If you've spent two weeks in quarantine you're safe to go out but as soon as you touch anything you're contaminated and can possibly spread it. It isn't easy to not be a contagion. If your community takes on the project of a quarantine then it is just of them to punish those who refuse to respect the law. The same goes for people being forced to stay if there isn't a quarantine in place the law should be respected. If social isolation is the decision and reccomendations are the tool then that obviously signifies a certain course of action with the qualifier that the punishment shouldn't be severe for breaking the recommended norm. Recommendations respect individual choice fully while still contributing to the common project of reducing the spread of the disease.
You shit talked Bernie for bragging about an endorsement from a comedian. I pointed out that Biden has accepted endorsements from far worse people. If you can bring up Bernie for no reason I can bring up Biden for no reason

Anyone who has to say I'm a democrat but... and then goes on to say they're either voting independent or republican is a bad faith troll. And since you've only been a user for about a month and all your posts are ragging on both sides I'm going to go with you're a bad faith troll. If both sides are so bad why do people who complain about both sides always try to push people to the right Really makes you think.
I never said they were insignificant.
if people die the economy gets hurt also. if people get sick hospitals become full. You know we have other sick people right they are the same as before the pandemic. where will they be treated
We re talking about a virus not a product with a corporation behind it. You can explain why you think that s comparable enough to bring up. Ah yes I m pretending to care about lives and you base that on not agreeing with my opinion. Good stuff
Thank you for your totally nebulous contribution.

That makes no sense. OP says people shouldn t be forced to NOT work. I said what if it s unsafe TO work. Commenter says nobody is forcing you in response to my comment about working... implying someone is being forced TO work. I get the point you re saying but that isn t at all what this conversation has devolved into. Also people dying is worse than people being broke. And that s to say nothing of the economic impact of mass deaths if the economy is your main concern.
gt which incidentally is one of the primary reasons why Sanders didn't gain support his supporters alienated everyone I just watched season 2 episode 5 of Narcos.

Trump's decision making process seems to consist of two criteria Does it make him look good to his base of supporters Does it piss off his critics Glad that he's found time to settle scores while the country is dealing with a pandemic.
Except that you are defining freedom in a negative sense because libertarians are trash enough to shy away from true positive freedom. Your freedom is also only really fit to work during peace time when there is no need for extraordinary action to solve a problem. Your rationale is very nice though because obviously the word freedom is clearly defined does have only one meaning and there are people who hate it. Sure. Everyone thinks their views bring freedom thus the word is utterly meaningless. It's just as much an object of philosophy as the word truth but I doubt you've read enough about that freedom of yours and what kind of practical and theoretical problems it poses.
What an insufferable article. I won t say it s an easy question but giving resources to that cruise ship could mean taking them away from US citizens who are the one s paying for the cost guard to help mostly foreigners. During a time where great shortage is anticipated giving resources away could mean the deaths of additional US citizens. Any one who think s it is an easy decision is likely insulated from the consequences.
No it's about exactly what I would expect them to say.
I blame Trump and the CDC for not telling people to wear masks on day 1. But the media endlessly pushed the lie that masks don t help so it s going to be hard for them to attack Trump for it.

Haven't heard much about climate change since this started.

Wait are you implying scientific research is relativistic and the Catholic Church isn't
Yeah I was making a joke about them being infiltrated by regular Americans which lead to them actually reporting this
I hope you're right. What I'm afraid of 20 years from now is a system that's gone so far off the rails that people long for the days when politicians were only as fucked up as Trump. Can we please not end up there.

Ok. so before the flames begin not a fan of the admin... That being said this is pop culture outrage culture at its finest. Just hear me out. Background I write and help to craft federal policy. Not that kind the stuff no one cares about. Do you know how much this happens on things no one is paying attention to Half the time the original author got way too cute with what is essentially near legal language. Someone who has a tighter grip on exposure asses the language and cleans it up for reality. Why Because should party X fail to keep the promises made by historical party Y they are subject to whatever the blowback is but aren't culpable for the language. Sure its absolute shit timing but not everything is a nefarious scheme. Now considering the other nefarious schemes that blowback is earned but in this case...after reviewing the language I'm about 95 certain. At no point should language of totality exist in scenarios of supply or demand. A million factors can fuck it up. Whoever wrote no...whoever approved the original statement was high and probably assumed we would never need it.
It s not a bad plan. Don t do anything. If the states fix it say your guidance led them to success. If they fail blame the states and poor state leadership. He s clearly taking this from as blameless position

Absolutely I m with you on that 100 My thoughts are the peaks around mid to late April will be because of the lockdown measures. There s no telling what happens when those measures are lifted. Even Italy isn t at that point yet. We may see another massive spike. So I m all for keeping the measures for a month or two but longer will have dire consequences. There are already 10 million people that have lost jobs from this.

You know what I find most ironic about media outlets like CNN If they hadn't gamed the system during the last election against Bernie he would have run against Trump and most likely have won All the wailing and gnashing of their teeth about evil Trump would never have happened if they had just done the job the way it is supposed to be done with at least a minimum level of integrity Four years later and they've proven they haven't learned a thing Trump's not perfect but they have made up so many fake stories about him who has the time or inclination to sort through their BS to find the grains of truth It took the Leftists seeing the press doing the same thing to Bernie yet again before a lot of them final saw the national media was rigged in Biden's favor this time prop him up all you want but does anyone really think he has a ghost of a chance against Trump even Bernie now he's had to turn full blown Socialist can't win But they will still gulp whatever drivel the media spouts about Trump even now
It's sad when you are given every chance to just admit you are wrong and you just double down even harder lol

No they think fewer people would vote if we put up a hurdle like getting an ID. Especially under regimes which require you to pay for it. Feel free to disagree with the argument there are plenty of valid arguments to be made for and against voter ID but you should get the arguments right.
He is your president. Until he is removed on the international stage his IS America.
Oh fuck no. I said no such thing.This is definitely on Trump and his administration. They defunded dismissed disease control operations tried to ignore the outbreak and spread overseas then their response to containing COVID 19 has been too little too late and continues to be too little too late.

But... If he's still the President regardless even after being impeached that doesn't matter at all does it
I don't see how it really makes much difference. Anybody in trump's administration would be just as bad. Honestly so long as they're all sucking donnie's dick they're all gonna be the same

Yep. On March 31 there were headlines because coronavirus had killed more people than 9 11 in the US. That was just over 4 days ago. The daily deaths since then March 31 912 April 1 1049 April 2 969 April 3 1321 We doubled in 3 days and are now at 7400 deaths. This is gonna get real bad real quick.
That s not actually how it works systemically with a fever. I m sorry to tell you but your 100 wrong. The body responds very differently depending on the disease process. You re not dealing with a healthy body once someone becomes this sick therefor the body has numerous processes that take place that ABSOLUTELY make a man of his size losing that amount of weight very likely.

I never would have thought Americans would have put up with this shit but I was clearly wrong. I guess it is better that we know what has been lurking down there in the muck while we were mistakenly thinking things were progressing.

Create the crisis. Exaggerate the crisis. Exploit the crisis. Blame Trump. It's being done so often it's predictable that news will leak out that the complainers are somehow responsible.
Hey look a false equivalency. Going out during the corona crisis is more like driving drunk then just driving. Also most of the non essential jobs are learning that working from home is better than paying the overhead of an office building.

gt set up tents Where are you getting the tents for four thousand people one remote navy base like Guam Youd be hard pressed to pull those up over night or in any relatively short time period in a Marine unit is the states let alone on a remote naval base. gt gotten enough tests SecNav said on March 26th four days prior to the letter that they were working on getting more test for the TR. Just like the tents we're hard strapped to get tests here in the U.S now add 6 000 miles and an isolated island and you can see where the difficulty lies. gt The captain obviously had a plan he just didn't get the ok from the Secretary to fulfil it. I think his plan again think was to get everyone off the ship in an uncontrolled fashion with the only option of sending them into town without knowing who was infected or not.
I used to spend a lot of time there and NY state is a whole different place than the island.

Flu hospitalization rate is about 1 COVID is 20 I disappointed that my side of the political aisle is revealing ignorance about basic statistics. It's not the fixed numbers that matter because numbers are an outcome of variables as they work over time. Yes at any given moment X say the middle of March the flu which had a six month head start on the population with a mortality rate of 1 Once COVID starts it's killing with a rate of about 1 in the middle of March point X it will be behind the flu in death numbers. But in a month or two by points Y and Z not only does it surpass the flu but skyrocket past it. The reason why COVID mortality would only be 1 is because of the draining hospitalization rate that takes up limited hospital resources to save lives in the process crowding out hospital beds for cancer patients heart attacks broken limbs and the normal amount of health problems that happen at any given moment that can't be treated because a new disease drags 1 out of every 5 people into the hospital to live unlike 1 out of every 100 with the flu. If only 1 out of every 100 COVID patients went to the hospital instead of 20 the kill rate of COVID would be 5 10 a 50 100 times kill rate of the flu. By the end COVID will have killed 10 times the amount of Americans as the flu has and hospitalized 20 times the amount of Americans as the flu has. That is the threat and why the President sees past this weird cognitive dissonance in r conservative to deny COVID. He sees the ratio and not the number creating the false equivalence of flu hospitalizes hundreds of thousands COVID maybe a little more but we don't shut down the economy for the flu which is an equivocation fallacy based on the large difference in mortality rates hospitalization rates and recovery requirements.
This is what I keep asking myself.....about all of this.

It's just that from his perspective in his ivory tower corporations are people the lower income 46 of the U.S population are leaches on society and we are a nation founded on religion and I can't go for that.

They didn't rig anything. They intentionally designed the system to not work for people trying to file for unemployment. Because I mean after all fuck those lazy ass takers.

So if we look at the word suppression its synonym is cease or something easier for your peanut brain stop Now if we look at voter suppression by making it a necessity to have Voter ID you re stopping a certain number of the population from voting hence Voter ID leads to the notion of Voter Suppression. Now what the democrats are offering from their side isn t voter suppression but rather freedom to vote without belting locked down to needing a Voter ID.

Why does any tomb need to be guarded if you aren't a pharaoh This is all about respect for the fallen especially the unknown. The changing of the guard ceremony is probably the most reverent and somber service I have ever been a part of and I have been to many church and funeral services I was with a school group a few years ago and one of the guards came out for changing the guard. He actually FAILED inspection. You could see a ripple through the crowd Also these guys take it 100 seriously and will stop and call out anyone who disturbs the site. It is an amazing experience that all Americans should see.
Isn t that the defense act Trump signed against them yesterday. That they have to prioritize US government then can sell the rest

Economy was already going into the toilet before the virus Trump was attacking the shit out of the fed to prop it up which is why we have less room to maneuver.
God shes stupid. Wholy shit.
That s what happens when things are uncertain and the government is doing nothing to assuage fears.
You have to start asking your moderate to conservative friends and family how much of this they will take They sold stock profited and told your grandparents they should die for the sake of the economy. Y'all as black as me in their eyes. Trump is a distraction the people enable him. History doesn't repeat itself but people do.

gt Maybe focusing on peach mints was a bit top of mind the past 3 years. The people tasked with maintaining our stockpile of medical supplies had zero to do with impeachments or investigations. Stop making excuses. It happened on their watch. They were supposed to do an inventory count. They didn't It's on them. This is what happens when you assume or just don't follow through. Just take the L and move on. You can't win them all.

Well third parties write some really excellent history books too. Some great studies of the USA have been written by British Canadian French and other historians just as Americans have written thoughtful thorough analyses of many other nations' history. Some great historical insights can be arrived at by virtue of the historian having an outside perspective on their chosen subject.

gt A lot of us are still working full days from home remotely. Agreed. And because of that you didn't file for unemployment. The huge increase in unemployment is due to all the poor bastards that having jobs that can't be done working remote. And these are the people many not all who currently think it's super to shut down the whole economy for something that affects a relative few. Because when the nonsense finally ends.....they will have no jobs to go back to because regardless of what we hear about government assistance many companies will be dead and not reviable.
This is false Read articles completely bloomberg.com gt I take this issue of European solidarity very seriously and am therefore certain there will be authorizations soon to export masks to certain countries Health Minister Jens Spahn said at a news conference in Berlin on Monday. We re not categorically against exports but want to understand what happens because previously it was so that masks went not where they were most needed but where most was paid.

gt It s hard to hear what you re saying. Maybe if you take trumps dick out of your mouth we could understand better. All I hear is this gaggy more daddy noise coming from your cum dumpster. It looks like I triggered one of your TDS fantasies. You hate Trump so much yet you wish he would punish you like your dad used to when you were 12. I'm sorry that you had to experience abuse at such a early age. I hope after you clean up you think about what you have done and seek help. TDS isn't a life sentence you can overcome it.

I'd love to talk about risk tolerance because we are absolutely not doing any risk assessment during this in any way. We take the worst case scenario make the the one we will plan for and act as if that is the truth consequences be damned.
Of course hes exaggerating. I feel pretty normal doesn't make ratings. I remember on 9 11 there was a journalist on one of the cable news networks who was right near the towers when they collapsed. She was in the studio when I first saw her and she had a bit of dust on her clothes. Not a huge amount but a little anyway. This person was interviewed off and on all day as we all tried to grasp what was happening. Never once did she ever have the appearance of trying to brush the dust off change clothes anything. This despite plenty of opportunity to do so. I dunno about you but my natural reaction is to brush myself off and it was strange to my 15 year old self how it appeared deliberate to preserve that look. That day started my questioning of journalism and its snowballed ever since.
The funniest part is how we will all feel when he gets reelected. Facepalm

I was speaking to the response. But of course that's the take of someone who believes Trump called it a hoax. The constant nothing this administration does is anything less than a disaster of earth ending proportions. You know what I'm always trying to be civil. You misrepresent my comment. You come to a sub just to attack people who have discussions about what they believe. I'm not the one who needs to evaluate what I'm doing.

Cool I bet all the people you share the virus to and kill will be totally on board with you taking that risk for your own economic concerns.
To be fair reports say they re mostly testing people who are severe enough to be hospitalized. The actual prevalence may be significantly higher. The good news from this would be the death rate decreases as the total number of cases rises so the death rate may be lower. My point is Take the statistics with a grain of salt
Oh god anecdotal the average redditor's response to everything they disagree with. No shit everything is anecdotal and enough anecdotes make a pattern.

The ability for banks to work definitely affects the median person. The lending market contracted in 08 and that in turn effects the ability for companies to make payroll people to get home loans credit cards and so much more. With the bailouts this was prevented from getting worse. Maybe benefitted isn't the right word but things were prevented from getting much worse.

It's tough. We get it. And it's not exactly partisan either. Some here think it's bullshit. Some leftists in the main stream media thought that as well. And some are scared and want to do everything we can to prevent any deaths. I certainly don't want to die from this because we don't have enough hospital beds and I otherwise would have survived. The point is the more authority we funnel up to the government the less freedom we have. We have more to balance than one pandemic. Like our future.
You can t not support this and support the lockdown and be ideologically consistent. If things are so dire we have to place everyone under house arrest illegally than surely stopping 3M from shipping life saving equipment overseas is justified.

Yes I hate Trump Seth hates Trump most of America hates Trump okay now get on to some other material. Besides that I just do not think this is something that should be reported on.

So I know this won't play well here but this is why many folks think that basic democratic socialist policies are good to have in place. There are people like yourself who are suffering through absolutely no fault of their own. There are people like myself who are mostly just inconvenienced. And there there are people profiting off this crisis. I'd be fine with raising my taxes forever to make sure we have support for folks like yourself in times like this. For all I know next time it will be me but I'm also okay with the idea that I might pay in my whole life and be lucky enough never to need help. I'd especially like to see companies reaping disproportionate profits pay appropriate taxes and use it to save those small businesses. We've had high taxes before and people still built great industries in America. If we had that kind of capital to distribute now we could save all those small businesses shutting down through no fault of their own. I hope you get through this. Stay safe and good luck.
Maybe I'm reading you wrong here. Are you calling a drug addiction or a mental illness a choice

I just read the Georgia order. The 10 or more only the way I read it applies to when gatherings are otherwise unavoidable. The order does not allow you to have any visitors other than health personnel and somebody coming to fix something vital in your home for the duration of the order.

I know the guy in this picture he is a good guy. Respect to him and all the other sentinels.
OK I am just going to report you you cant even come here and engage peacefully without being a prick.
Restrictions is the wrong word. I think we need to use more information of what is actually happening on the ground. The models have been shown to be heavily overstated. The CDC guidelines are incredibly tight and all states are incorporating those. My state as of last night has had over 250k unemployment claims in two weeks with under 800 cases and only 18 deaths with a median age of 83. The fact of the matter is that this is something that attacks those that are vulnerable and we should be implementing policy and guidelines based on that. We can find a way to live life and protect those that are vulnerable.
You're being intentionally obtuse. I'll give you a philosophical question to consider. Why do we value human life What constitutes human life Is a human life defined by feeling pain for example someone can have nerve damage and not feel pain
Didn t know Either an idiot or a liar.
Because Trump and his lackeys are incompetent and even his efforts to help others which he only would do if he can get something in return are miserable. He denies support to those who badmouth him but feeds crumbles of moldy bread to those who might be of use to him.
I support the subsidizes too but I don't think its enough to support the industry.. And I am not a fan of throwing more money at a problem lol Tough issue.

The death toll alone plus the unemployment and the market losses Not to mention he gaslit his own cult to play fast and loose with CORONA and now the leopards are eating their faces.

Trust me I do. You can joke about blacks and gays all you want if it's funny. This is political sub joking about cancelling pride and all the anti gay comments isnt funny.
Electronic voting is even worse since it allows complete fraud from a central location. How do you know the total is correct if you can only check your individual ballot Blockchain might get us partly there but then you lose your anonymity. With physical ballots we can institute chain of custody and two person integrity among other processes to limit the opportunities for fraud. The big problem is with mail and electronic now you can create a person that never existed and it's damn near impossible to prove. In person with ID is the only way to know a real human voted. Exceptions to in person should be just that exceptions.

We already have limits on religious practice. We already have limits on freedom of assembly. We already have limits on freedom of expression and yes look it up you already dont have absolute right to your property the state can simply take it if there is a greater need. You live in a country where your rights are so carefully and meticulously well regulated you have no idea that they are...so you have already given up your rights. And look I know there are cases of overstep but I also understand that the Constitution is an old and often vague document. we have an entire branch of Government that dedicates considerable resources to interpret this thing and try to apply it to our modern problems. Quit acting like we are constantly on the precipice of losing everything. And not every Democrat goes on about taking guns away full stop you brainwashed idiot.
I wasn't responding to the article. So you need to quote what Kusher said and ask me a proper question. I'll be surprised if you actually do that.

I actually don't have a problem with this in theory. Any time you have a disaster of this magnitude you should do a review. It is good policy to figure out where you screwed up and make changes for next time. With that being said Adam full of Schiff is only doing this because orange man bad.
I understand you disagree with the example. Are you trying to imply that the government has zero authority to ever restrict any of these basic human rights I m asking because that seems extreme and if someone were to assume that was your point they d probably be accused of setting up a straw man.
I actually consider myself pretty liberal but losing what little faith I had left in humanity. Politics in the US are so polarized now it seems like there s no going back. People are living in two different realities based on the things they want to believe and it seems like the actual real world gets lost in the confusion. Truth doesn t really matter as long as it fits your viewpoint.

My sentiments exactly.
I think the two problems are 1. That materials for the mask come from Canada. 2. 3M makes more masks outside the USA than inside. So if other countries followed trumps lead you would end up with net less masks.
So Obama either gave him broken tests for a virus that didn't exist or didn't give him any tests for the virus that didn't exist. Either way he's clearly a monster.
I hate trump more than most but if you think that international politics have anything to do with a popularity contest you re way too naive.
better for who Im just saying the voter demographics will change. Older generations werent liking socialism. All Im talking about is healthcare and this pressing issue. I think after this witch hunt bullshit is over Trump will do something twitter.com s 21
It means Donald Trump will not stop until every position with even a shred of oversight for the Executive is occupied by an uncompromising sycophant or simply not occupied at all. Beyond that there may be more immediate implications but I'm a bit of a dumb dumb myself.

His second question was just a rehash of questions he's already asked. I wish he'd catch the common cold and be forced to stay home for awhile. Acosta brings nothing to the briefing journalism wise
I honestly had no idea that was a thing. Is the thinking like most people think a black person should speak ebonics so people are surprised when they don't so they compliment it but it's just supposed to be normal if a professional presents themselves well Serious question I have no idea
gt it will also remove premium payments This is always the rebuttal. There are millions of Americans who only go to the doctor once a year for their completely covered checkup. There are also millions of Americans that are healthy and opted to pay the fine under the ACA than pay for health insurance because it was cheaper than coverage. Elimination of premiums means fuck all to those people because they aren t a problem. We can t ignore the very real fact that there will be millions of Americans who will get fucked by M4A in the transition and once it is implemented. The fact that the only thing that has been thrown out as a solution to this problem is the elimination of premiums means that it hasn t been thought through how these millions of Americans won t get fucked.

Beyond this one low risk asymptomatic individual typically has some contact with high risk individuals. I do not know the statistic of individuals over the age of 70 who are living alone but I do know that many do live in the same household. With that said if we could somehow ensure a significant isolation of high risk individuals those with pre existing illnesses and seniors its a plausible alternative. But I do not anticipate it is that easy for us to do.

Best wishes to your family. That said people are put in similar positions from the flu every year.

Many of these people fight for their lives because of the flu yet nothing shuts down. And never once have I ever heard family members of those with the flu tell people what if it happens to you
Where exactly did I say anything about not taking the win I'm saying gt I am glad he has turned I am also making it clear we are not forgetting what he did which helped trump to get to where he is in order to cause the damage he did. There is no refusal to take the win in saying Welcome we will discuss the fact you contributed to the problem after we have fixed it.
Yep. Bet he saw pence speaking from the podium with the presidential seal and realized he was being overshadowed.
You think this crybaby nonsense is how you win elections Good luck with that.
Pence is fucking terrifying as a leader. Not only has he been complicit in all of Trump's fuckery he's also a religious lunatic and he appears somewhat normal. He could do so much more vile shit than Trump
My point being that I don't think anyone is upset with you about that.
This entire family is so pathetic.
They did Here is the clip youtu.be Here is a good one where the women said it's the safest time to fly and the entire crew was saying this is just a flu youtu.be
Given the fact that this pandemic is going to be a facet of everyday life for at least the next 18 months or until a vaccine is developed and by extension is going to determine whether there should will be any large scale gatherings there is zero argument not to start building the infrastructure for this. If for no other reason than as a contingency in case widespread social distancing regulations are still in effect come fall. But no. I'm going to make the not so bold assertion that the Trump administration is going to drag their feet on this until election time rolls around COVID 19 is still prevalent then they'll say there isn't enough time in implement mail in voting before the actual election day. That's why Pelosi and the Democrats are working to get this ball rolling here and now while there's still plenty of time to set it up. And it's also why the Republicans will work to obstruct it every step of the way.
I'm fairly certain you're joking but the world is so screwed up I can't actually tell.
That s a fair point. After all it s the job of the executor to micromanage every department and make sure they re replenishing any stocks they re supposed to have. s
They are 13 of our GDP nationally combined so while you might not think much of them if NYC and Los Angeles just dipped you'd feel it in a hurry. NYC is vastly more important than any state that's not CA or TX from an economic standpoint and LA NYC is more important than any state that's not CA. We'd all rather lose Utah Colorado Nebraska and Missouri than NYC or LA.
Nice.
You first need the machine that creates the masks guess what. It's Germany
That comment caused me to exhale with such force that let out a single snort well played. And yeah you re probably right. First the war on education then the war on terror and now the war on a virus and a sudden dearth of materials.

The states are freaking out. The governors are poor managers that do not know how to manage supply. They hear ventilators and respirators are needed to they order as many as they can afford with good intent but not all are needed at that particular time. NY is going through hell. The federal government is pulling strategically from where they can I order to save lives. If that means pissing off a few foreign countries and governors that are scared that is fine. This pandemic is a war. Cooler heads will prevail. I hate to say it but Trump is doing the right thing. The patriots truck is varying supplies from the private team plane that came from China. Not intended for MA ever anyone reporting that is fake news. The federal government wants the Krafts of the US to be doing this sort of thing. It is exactly what should be happening. Additionally Where are all the wealthy celebrities Those people are garbage and should never be treated like anything more after all this. They literally are donating product that they cannot sell and using the value as a way of saying that they donated thousands. It is Bullshit. Finally The 1 that wants to stay wealthy should be proving their worth at this very moment.
He should be rather awarded for giving a damn about the soldiers and not merely using the soldiers as a prop to win votes during elections like most politicians do.
Here's the transcript Acosta And where is Dr. Fauci Trump I don't know. Every time he's not here. Sometimes I'll ask him to come because that's the first question that you and a couple of others from the Fake News Establishment ask is Where's Dr. Fauci We're doing great together. We're covering a different subject today. Go ahead Acosta Different subject Trump Go ahead Jim try another one BTW notice the camera flashes during the answer. Such a theatre Note how Trump totally controls the room letting Jim still ask another question nonetheless. Without being rude or abrasive just firm. Note that even Acosta himself is amused at President's portrayal of the question.
lmao they don t have much to show for it. They were good at enabling Bush to kill a million Iraqis ill give them that. They controlled all three branches of government and has a senate supermajority for a time and they couldn t even get a fucking public option. It s pathetic. America has shifted so far to the right on economic issues that they think a shitty healthcare bill partially written by the heritage foundation was some huge accomplishment and even that was gutted by the Republicans a few years later. Incrementalism has always been a scam medium.com andrewdobbs no voting democrat is not harm reduction 8cda28633858
It's very clearly collapsing and 2016 is very clearly the moment when the big blow is struck. What we're seeing is the body slowly falling to the ground. The moment where it hits it is going to be interesting to say the least.
What about other places like American Samoa and US Virgin Islands No Guam or Northern Mariana Islands
Sure I get the warning but not gt You should check it out for a few days until you finally grasp the severity of the situation the entire world is in. I take a conservative view of self defense. In other words I'm going to give as good as or better than I get. If you want to address civility I think it would be great to start at the first incivility rather than only the one fighting back.
No we aren t we haven t used the options.

buy themselves healthcare and not depend on the government i.e other people to buy it for them.
More like the toilet outside of the pool.
Apparently some people think that there is no such thing as personal collective responsibility and that public crises and the law don't apply to them. Rule of law is an incredibly important principle to conservatives. People are going to unknowingly infect others when unfettered. This would hurt the economy businesses and in turn individuals in a far worse way if there was no temporary restrictions during a time of crisis. Sure there are immoral government officials that take advantage of bad situations but so do private citizens. There are two unrelated issues here.
RHEEEEE
Donald Trump is a traituh. He's also a crook a cheat a liuh and a con man but I feel like being a traituh is the worse crime. He may very well be the worst human being the United States of America has evuh produced.
He is funny. And correct. You just don t understand him probably.
Vote Biden vote down ticket... even if you wanted Sanders to win his policies were never getting implemented in 2020. Large scale change takes multiple elections and we can pass Bernie's policies if we vote year in and year out across the board.
which is why I mean food's not free. You can eek by without a job but you'll almost certainly be homeless at least and few would choose that life.
Here's the thing about factcheck.org The have a funny way of arbitrarily taking things literally or figuratively depending on the outcome they want. The article literally says that the Obama administration depleted make and did not replenish them. Then the Trump administration took over. Literally Trump inherited a depleted inventory of supplies. The statement is in fact true. But here come the factcheck.org writers to carry water for the Democrats. So since Trump didn't actively replenish those supplies and so they claim ignored warnings about it then he didn't actually inherit the problem... Suddenly because Trump didn't fix the issue before it became a problem the meaning of inherit isn't to be taken literally. Let's not even mention that in 2010 the Democrats and Obama passed a massive overhaul of the medical industry that placed significant regulations on medical device manufacturers... But I'm sure that didn't exacerbate the problem.
VOTE HIM OUT. V O T E

Lets hope the gop as it is dies an ugly death as it deserves.
Ahh yes President Benjamin Franklin
A good conservative does not and I cannot stress this enough DOES NOT value any loss of freedom based on the person taking it away. I know you guys think we just worship Trump and all that other bullshit you guys spew all day long but a lot of us have been personally holding his feet to the fire in our own minds and will not vote for him again if we think he is a danger to our inherent freedoms.

I still consider myself a Lutheran though I don't really practice anymore. Morality has nothing to do with believing in Good or going to church. The people who believe that are the ones who have no other choice the ones who fill those pews on Sunday for no other reason but themselves. They're desperate to right themselves with someone anyone because they know they aren't right with themselves.

In that case I assume that you find it utterly impossible for anyone to listen watch him speak and come to the conclusion that he sounds like an idiot. That's interesting. I also assume that you have convinced yourself that any harsh criticism of Trump is liberal spin. Also interesting.
And that's where you are misunderstanding the time frame of the water weight loss. He lost 11 in 3 days meaning he could have lost 4 the first 4 the second and 3 the third. For a high dehydration point of 11 His body could have stopped dropping water weight at that point and began restoration of it's average water weight level depending on how is recovery from Covid 19 was.
gt The report said that British officials had been less than accommodating of the Durham team. For example investigators were refused by British authorities earlier this year when they requested an interview outside formal more time consuming channels with former British spy Christopher Steele. gt Moreover Sir Andrew Wood the former U.K Ambassador to Russia who first brought the Steele dossier to the attention of the late Sen. John McCain in late 2016 said he had been contacted by investigators from Durham s team and had refused to cooperate. Wood responded to an inquiry from The Wall Street Journal by email on Thursday. He wrote My answer to an enquiry by email from a member of the team about 2016 some weeks ago was that I had nothing to add to what was already on the public record. That strongly indicating a CIA UK Intel plot.

Trump actually just proposed expanding Medicare to pick up the covid tab for the uninsured. Like covid specific m4a. Democrats are getting outflanked on the left by a goddamn fascist it's fucking pathetic.
I tested positive for coronavirus and lost about 15 pounds in one week. I'm sure some of that was water weight but it's mostly from having no appetite and not eating anything while burning off a ton of calories being sick. This is really serious stuff.
There will be a stronger push towards automation and virtual work. If we're lucky our economy will become more seld sufficient again.
I mean there is definitely going to be another one since this is going to last quite a lot longer. But it shouldn't be fast tracked. The first checks haven't even been sent out. They need to work out a way for people who aren't getting it DD first since some will be waiting until August for their first check.
Okay so my thoughts and prayers are with the people of Alabama but I'm wondering how that could affect other places. One of my concerns in Chicago is taking the proper precautions for the foreseeable future but getting boned when people who didn't take those precautions come to visit. But if people in Alabama are just lining up to die does that mean they'll have a really shitty few weeks and then be done with it and no longer a risk to others Where everyone who could have gotten it has already done so Whereas places that have been doing shelter in place will have a less shitty few months while people slowly get infected Because the whole point of flattening the curve means fewer people are straining the hospitals but the whole thing lasts longer.
To be fair if everyone smelled like shit too you wouldn t notice.
Why
Someone said something along the lines of covid proving that America is just a third world country with Gucci clothes. That statement is wrong. As proved my 90 of our leadership we are a first world country run by idiots with less than half a brain cell between the lot of them
Facts don't care about your feeling
I am in Washington and I am worried that the flattening of the curve has more to do with lack of testing rather than the shelter in place order.
I just went on twitter to see if she actually tweeted that because I was so sure it was satire Just wow Good job NY
Fuck that. Jam them up any precedent we can eventually their lies get too expensive. If we don't try making lies expensive they'll just keep lying. Sometimes it's not about winning the case it's just about forcing them to muster
Yeah man take a number
Also yes. Can't they both be unqualified and be products of nepotism
If its a useful antidote that is. Besides that s not the trump blame you should worry about. His handling of this crisis is abysmal by any standards.
Pussies
So the local government ordered the beaches closed because they couldn't patrol and staff them but the state overruled the locals. Got it. Florida is playing this same game So local government is bad now s I guess they mean not like that. This is like that bathroom thing again or local ordinances about plastic bags getting overridden by the state.
Sure. I m definitely for reasonable personal protection. I just don t know how a I feel about war grade rifles. I don t know where to set the cutoff for mental incompetence or danger to society. I think there has to be a way to make sensical laws but I m certainly not the one to propose the right ones. I think we need to invest in the research that will lead to the right balance between personal safety and constitutional protection of rights.
This determination to never be incorrect at all costs is gonna kill so many people.

You may not be but honestly a lot of people are saying otherwise. For example most libertarian humor page are full of people unironically bragging about ignoring the quarantine because government bad. It's really heartbreaking to see I mean I get it exercise your freedoms but not when putting others at risk.
That's a rant and what you display is hardly conservative thinking at all. Maybe your post is better suited for r politics or something like that.
I agree with locking down heavily affected areas. But I disagree on not having to lockdown Wyoming now until we have a rapid accurate mass produced test that can be administered to anybody who wants to go back to work. Until that happens I think we should only have vital workers going to work. What happens if somebody unknowing exposes a Wyoming congregation on a Sunday. Now you have a lot more cases and more infectious people possibly spreading this virus around Wyoming. Is Wyoming equipped to handle this disease Is that something we want to risk I don t.
Don't you think the fake part I was thinking of was Vox editing out 100 of what Kushner was talking about from the original text completely changing the underlying meaning in the process Especially since that's entirely what my original comment focuses on
Pastors priests and ministers and rabbi and imams and other faith leaders if you care about your congregations tell them to stay home.
I thought this was going to be a r roastme post
It's so weird I've got this one hand with empathy and then this other that wants to slap the shit out of people who think like this. This is happening all over the planet more or less and is affecting everyone's economy and even with that things are still going fairly well from an economic standpoint. Young people WILL get sick also and trying to cherry pick this sickness like it only affects old people is bullshit it just has a higher chance is all. Try looking for work for jobs where they need people right now and I've seen places looking for workers left and right and I'm not in a big city by any means. Of course this will just be anecdotal evidence as per usual cause no one else but young people have ever experienced anything horrible in life or other bad situations before.
I m sorry but you re wrong During a Feb. 28 2020 campaign rally in South Carolina President Donald Trump likened the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him saying this is their new hoax. Despite creating some confusion with his remarks Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax. From Snopes
And solve the opiod crisis.
Even assuming severe dehydration and not eating anything that number would be pretty difficult to hit.
I started out at 160lbs though...
This argument always comes up and it's understandable why it's the first suggestion. It makes deductive sense. But it's a deductive conclusion derived from false premises. Poverty is a singular outcome yes but it can manifest from many different scenarios and situations. People can be poor for many different reasons and a one size fits all solution to poverty is not going to adequately address disparities between different groups of poor people. The solution to solving COVID 19 related deaths in rural white Appalachia might be a smoking cessation program. The same program in urban black Michigan would probably be ineffective because what they really need is a nutritionally focused intervention. Giving money to poor people doesn't adequately address the factors influencing poverty in different groups of people. The same reasoning can be applied to this outbreak COVID 19 kills people in different categories at different rates for different reasons.
I noticed you conveniently ignored the parts of his arguments you don t have an answer to.
Sad fucking reality and country that Biden is the best we can do. And yet here we are.
I'm going to be only speaking for myself here. When Trump initially made the claim there were very few studies among which one had overwhelmingly positive results that could substantiate. I get there are people desperate to get any cure but that decision should have been left to the doctor and patient at that time. Now that we have more corroborating studies it's definitely a good sign. I didn't agree with Trump hyping it up then when there was very little corroboration and I certainly didn't agree when that Governor can't remember who put a ban on it. I'm pretty sure everyone wants a cure ASAP. Optimism from Trump is fine but I think it should've been a more generic message rather than saying Hey this XYZ drug looks promising at that point in that context. EDIT There's still questions on how much production can be ramped up will there be issues for people who still currently need it as part of their prescriptions etc. but I'll defer those for later
Remember it s not just one outlet All news has sensationalized to stay alive and many people use that to feed their own fuel

gt itep.org LOL Nice source. It's a liberal think tank
Honestly too if there s a section of a nation which continues to vote for Trump to ensure his re election the country deserves to burn. That s ironically how a democracy works too. The people have simply chosen their own destruction.

Then riot or protest or fucking something if you're not gonna vote. Otherwise you're responsible for idiots getting power
I'm outraged just like they were in pre Nazi Germany.
It's the federal governments stockpile to do with what they see fit. The problem is this country is far too divisive to see this issue clearly. Half the country do not trust this administration. I personally think we need to seriously be questioning Jared Kushners role in the adminstration and federal government. Not just this snaffu but his dealings from the start. I honestly think it's in the best interest of the administration for him to resign. Come to think of it I wouldn't be surprised if the president fired him. It would make for better headlines...
They're all lawyers working their way up the chain. Catching bigger and bigger clients along the way.
No we will but everyone will be on stay at home orders in the midst of a pandemic and the ballots will only be mailed out to people over 65. Or whoever is left over 65.
I m not I m just incredibly pissed that people would do this. First they say the virus is nothing to worry about and then they try and blame this on the US government while at the same time purposefully spreading it Come on man that s messed up
It s not been. Seems mean spirited and sarcastic but all the time. It s reddit for you. Maybe it s how you feel better or something.
Only after denouncing and waiting 5 turns though
Great idea And use the proceeds to fund single payer health care so our national spend rates aren t totally fucked compared to every other developed nation

The virus that we re talking about having to do a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat as the heat comes in typically that will go away in April he said. Referring to the United States he added We re in great shape though. We have 12 cases 11 cases and many of them are in good shape now.
I never wanted kids anyway.
Importing cheap foreign labor forces Americans out of work which leads to a strain on the social safety net which leads to budget shortfalls which leads to higher taxes that consumers most certainly do not like. Also lower costs are not always a good thing. Slavery lowers the costs of goods but it is also shitty and should not be allowed. Same logic applies to destroying your domestic industries by depending on foreign labor.
They should probably hold both people accountable.
This is essential

Uh I m relaxed. I m exploring the hypothetical that permanent border closures would be a horrible idea for the economy and world stability. Certainly we need to re evaluate our dependency on outside supply chains and the notion that extreme efficiency in these supply chains has no downside. Reasonable changes there will also likely have negative near term economic effects but it may be the necessary price to pay for a more robust and resilient system.
Well raw meat in packages then they go on the germy conveyor belt that everyone else's raw meat packages to on then they go in the germy shopping carts...like I said I am a little bit of a germophobe. Lol.

That's some bad theory there my man. A backdoor into completely obliterating many fundamental freedoms. The consequences are not assumed but need to be proven in a court of law.

He truly thinks he is the smartest person in the rule and this is all simple solvable problems to him. You can say it on his unearned face. No business being up there.
Not everyone will need hospitalization of course but there are a lot of Covid patients a lot more than those who would die anyway who can survive provided that they can medical help hell some are on ventilators for a week I have no idea why you think I implied that it applies to all sick people.

Plenty of small business owners have fragile egos and want yes men also.
I have to agree Trudeau like most leaders of other countries will act like a responsible adult. Sadly I think he may and will have to force the issue to deal with trump. I don't think trump knows or well cares how integrated both our countries are. Not just industries but the people as well. There are thousands of nurses techs and other support staff that commute across the canadian border into the states to work in american hospitals. There was a news article mentioning Windsor city alone could have upwards of 2000 crossing daily to work Detroit hospitals. Who knows what the actual number is when you consider all the other cities.
Neither does Biden.
Yeah what s really scary is that this virus will likely be a threat for years realistically. They could do this again.
Wear scarves you know scarves that people wear a scarf you wear around your neck twirls fingers you can wear a scarf and cover your face with the scarf. So that was 2 minutes of his 2 hours long press conference.
gt Also I think that OP doesn t mean that he can go outside without being restricted. I don t think he is trying to seem harmful Based on the responses in the comments you thought wrong.
Trump has a rambling off the cuff way of speaking. It's refreshing because he's more transparent than past administrations but unfortunately it makes it easier for the media to take his words out of context.
Here is the thing. People over 65 are 56 more likely to vote Republican and they come out in large numbers. 10 20 death hospilation from coronavirus may not be enough to change that 6 difference however... Who over 65 is going to come out to vote if they are told to stay at home That's a huge loss to Trump wjen states are won with smaller margins. He's hurting his own voters.
If they know who to actually blame. This article here is blaming so appointee for the problems created in its inception by Rick Scott. Pretty sure the republicans will be pointing the finger in a 1000 different directions to avoid culpability
As am American I agree. I apologize to you for our government being so messed up.
Stop arguing. This person doesn t know what they re talking about. You re absolutely correct. It s 100 possible we re talking about VERY sick people not healthy normal individuals. You can t compare apples and oranges. Save your breath.
We effectively have a choice between 2. Choose the best one. Don't choose the worst one or no one because an ideal one wasn't available or risk getting the worst one. Then keep trying for the ideal one.

You get to hear there other side on all the default subs. This is a place to speak right wing opinions without being drowned out by down votes and timeouts.
Why do you care. I'd he's lying then who gives a fuck. This has nothing to do with anything and honestly I'm so tired of this sub wasting time on bullshit like this. He's sick with a deadly disease he's probably extremely stressed everyone responds to stress differently so who's to say this isn't true.
You guys do a good job but it s like killing roaches you can t get them all and lots of redditurds do get through especially when a rare thread makes it to r all.
What went wrong Well we can start with the Democrats interfering with every single action the President has taken during the last 3 years but specifically these past few months. Impeachment took over our Government from November through February. It was a partisan effort that accomplished nothing but waste everyone's time. This idea that well Trump should have ignored us trying to remove him from office is fucking ridiculous. After impeachment failed did the Dems and the media turn their attention to the Coronavirus No but Trump and his team did. And how did the Dems respond They pushed back against things like the travel bans that actually ended up saving our asses. It was termed a distraction. The only thing we heard about during February after impeachment was the Dem primary. Debate after debate. Continued attacks on the president. Not a peep about Coronavirus. It wasn't until early March that anyone outside of Trump started taking this seriously in America. And then suddenly the Dems are upset that Trump didn't bypass congress and start taking dictatorial control of the country....aka the things they were trying to impeach him for a month before. Adam Schiff is directly responsible for delaying any Coronavirus response. Nancy Pelosi is directly responsible. Nadler Schumer all of them fiddled while the virus snuck in. The Democrats have control over the house and the media and they did nothing but point fingers. The Democrats failed our country.
Don't really want Biden but I'll absolutely vote him over Trump
Lol how naive can you be
We were hoping the ShamDemic would help us and now it looks like it won t
If trump wins again this county will revolt. He ll never make it to his second term
Well for starters...an estimated 160 million people are either overweight or obese.
Than you obviously have no experience running small businesses or have any contact with those owners. The effects of closing down businesses and sending the US into a depression are far worse than even 150k people dying from a virus. And we don't even know if that will happen. The death rate has flattened in Washington where it first started 80k people died in the flu season of 2017 for comparison.
gt Even Shapiro said that Well if a podcaster said so it must be true.
Estimates of damage to our economy are far higher than 1. 08 trillion... We should divest all Chinese investmen in the US as well. Especially the damn media and social media. How the hell was a communist country allowed to buy into so many media and social media outlets
God no. Fuck Bill Barr. Wonder what he has on Durham. Durham's already shown he's acting like a shill and he actually had a good reputation unlike Barr.
I m trying to understand this The problem you have with illegals is that they are using our resources right But you re willing to waste even greater resources to possibly stop them from coming here It s one thing if we could guarantee that it would work but how is it a good idea to potentially throw away so much money
Was not the point of the the original post to fault Obama Didn t he hold the same position as Trump

gt Dont you already have to check in as an already registered voter to vote anywhere So why even need a separate ID Cant you just present your state ID driver's license That's what voter ID is in most cases. That's how dumb Democrats are. Voter ID laws require that someone have a valid form of identification to vote. When states started to give out drivers licences to illegal immigrants that made it even more complicated and that's why some people advocate for a special ID meant specifically for voting.

Kushner is just openly showing the attitude they have about this country not at all different from the fictitious Sopranos who acted as if they owned North Jersey and deserved a piece of every bit of action that took place therein. And anyone who plays by the rules is a sucker.

You smug disingenuous bastard. You know exactly what you meant by this post and you expected support. I'm glad this sub isn't completely insane.
My bad it was Maine not NJ. nytimes.com Hmm I can't remember where i read the full story that article seems like it's just a headline. But I've read other stories about a couple of men being blockaded into their home by locals because they were believed to be visiting from New York I think that was the one in NJ.

FYI the intelligence community inspector general is the guy who certified the complaint about Trump withholding military aid from Ukraine in exchange for the announcement of an investigation from the Ukrainian government into Joe Biden's son. He had certified the complaint as an urgent concern and as legitimate. This is what Trump is up to while people are dying.
We're so fucked.

At least most of that money is going to Americans instead of the 9 trillion Obama practically handed over to corporations and foreign governments. As for the plan to get the economy roaring again... dude it's the United fucking States. Show a little respect to your fellow country mates... we've overcome multiple recessions... we've overcome the Great Depression... and we'll overcome this shit.
I fully agree with you. It's like some people see exploitation in the market and think See Free Market when the market is being manipulated. People will need to pay more for food however that money is going to be recirculated back into American pockets because American workers are being paid. Additionally this might be the incentive some farmers need to industrialize further and move heavier into automation. Having this pseudo slave labor force just continues to encourage poor business management.
Imagine basing your political decisions solely on what you think will most piss off the other side.
I think the ideal principle is pretty good assuming the population is educated and self sufficient and responsible. I think over time it would make sense to move towars that. Generally speaking though the expansion of the franchise has lead to the expansion of the size and scope of the government. Both parties have had to shift further and further to the left to kowtow to the growing appetite of free shit The voters that don't care enough to get off their ass or get an ID to vote probably do not care too much to begin with.
Thought about this but the intesivists and ICU docs are discharging patients to home in HCQ. It s might be the EM docs that see the patient in the ED and discharge to home in HCQ.
When all the facts and the real truth comes out we will realize that this is a terror attack from the Chinese government. Their goal is to control and rule the world. I pray that we all realize what China is doing. America has to get out of China and control our own destiny. I hope it is not too late. Also China needs to be run out of our colleges and businesses They pay off and control a lot government officials

I m not saying you re morally or ethically wrong but there is Supreme Court precedence for this kind of thing. Jacobson V Massachusetts. A pastor was refusing to get a small pox vaccination and therefore putting his congregation in danger. Here s a relevant quote from the decision in every well ordered society the rights of the individual in respect of his liberty may at times under the pressure of great dangers be subjected to such restraint to be enforced by reasonable regulations as the safety of the general public may demand. Again I m not claiming the decision is right or wrong just that the Supreme Court has given the government tremendous latitude in times of crisis to do what it deems necessary.
The problem is that he didn't just need permission. He needed resources. Specifically as he described in his letter assets.documentcloud.org he needed rooms to quarantine all 4000 of his Sailors individually. That's something that as I predicted reddit.com more than 2 weeks ago when we got the first indications that the virus had made it on board Navy ships the Navy is simply not prepared to provide at any significant scale. Captain Crozier needed help from the civilian government in Guam and he didn't have the authority to ask for that himself.

Wonder who he will inherit the double digit unemployment numbers from.

Well reusable bags are typically a pretty low risk for contracting a life threatening illness. I d say your debit card or cash are usually much dirtier. No argument here that people should wash them. It seems like a pretty simple idea that throwing less garbage into the environment is a generally good idea.
There's a lot of assholes of every description doing despicable stuff like this. As much as I dislike China I think it's more a horrible human thing rather than a single country thing.

Vote against every Republican you can
I don t support Trump. I agree he s an idiot. That s not really what I was talking about though. I was talking about the structures in place that reinforce certain world views. And the societal pressure that punishes people who question the way things are done. I know people can think for themselves. I m just saying that I can see how people might believe things like that. If you can t maybe you should read a damn book.
Interesting he didn't name a replacement either. Hmmm.
Here s the thing Trump has no special knowledge on this drug. He certainly doesn t know better than the actual scientists working hard to find a treatment. He just heard that the drug might be worth looking into and then proceeded to praise it as a magical cure to the nation. That was irresponsible regardless of whether it turns out that it is an effective treatment or not. And since you mention Dr. Fauci he is not sold on hydroxychloroquine at all video.foxnews.com sp show clips
Where exactly did I say anything about moral purity I'm saying gt I am glad he has turned I am also making it clear we are not forgetting what he did which helped trump to get to where he is in order to cause the damage he did. There is no emphasis on moral purity in saying Welcome we will discuss the fact you contributed to the problem after we have fixed it.

The bigger threat would be to imply that the pulp 3M or any American company would need for the masks would be redirected to a country willing to sell the masks fairly. Because the pulp needed to make the polymer is produced in BC.
One one hand I'm seeing stories about how the economy is collapsing people are out of work stores are out of stock and some desperate people can't afford food even if it was in stock... and then on the other hand I'm seeing smug people claiming that there's no reason anyone would need a gun to defend themselves in this situation.

I have no idea if he did but it is entirely possible. When I caught campylobacter I lost 16lbs the first week. Your body purges everything and its difficult to stay hydrated. Mostly water weight but still. It's possible. Now I don't know who this guy is and I'm not gonna search for him. But the loss of weight I think would definitely show.
Wow how did I miss that Thank you for speaking slowly so I could catch up
He averages 33 pinocchios every 20 minutes.
Not saying you need to prefer Biden or even vote for him if you choose not to. That is your choice alone. However please at least take the time to read his platform. The attacks of h being a republican are rediculous. He is more progressive than Obama was in platform. As progressive as Sanders Of course not. But there is vastly more daylight between him and Trump than there is him and Sanders.

Why isnt this big news
As soon as Jared Kushner is done solving the pandemic he'll be moved to there. Unless Trump has another unqualified relative he can toss in the mix.
I don't know who posted this but there's no way that Biden is under the impression that Trump needs to physically in person sign his actual name using a sharpie on every single check. The presumption of this post only makes Republicans look dumber than we already do to these people. Let's please not help them in their cause. This is ridiculous. This is nitpicking journalism and just makes us look like ignorant children. It doesn't even rise to the level of absurdity.
There are 2. 4 3 million people who die every year. Did we shut down the economy for any of them What about the 1 million babies aborted every year You can't even get Congress to deny funding for it. Hysteria is not a way to live or operate a country. Take necessary precautions. Expand facilities to handle potential case load. Go about your lives. Those who are at risk elderly or people with other health conditions should remain in isolation. Government should be spamming on information avenues with Public Service Announcements. Good ads youtube television radio etc. The response to this bug will cause devastating to progress and growth. When we have a real Spanish Flu type event our country will be so impacted by the stupidity here that we won't be able to respond to it.

Trump Administration probably also took into account that the Obama administration decided that the masks were not needed to fight a pandemic as they had left them at that stocking level for years. Do you think during the mock pandemic the Obama administration would point out where they had kept a dangerously low stock for 7 years

I mean that's somewhat true but only if ignoring that Trump spouted new lies and misinformation based on what he heard and then Fox repeated the feedback adding even more bullshit.
Nah shit
gt Why and how are private hospitals just sitting on vents at all right now It's a hard sell to get a hospital to give up critical equipment that they know that they'll need soon even if it's needed much more critically elsewhere right now. This is the position that much of the upstate region is in right now there's not that many cases now but there's going to be soon. And especially in the rural parts of the state where a hospital may only have a couple ventilators that they're 100 anticipated to need within the next 6 weeks it's going to be tough to get them to expose themselves to that vulnerability both from a personal and liability standpoint. The hospital admin doesn't want to give up the ability to treat patients and they don't want to be sued when a patient dies because they lent out the ventilator they needed to survive.
Does this bitch ever let up.

I'm guessing you've never been carjacked or had another driver intentionally try to run you off the road You know in NJ they've been blocking roads with trees and coming after you with a lynch mob if they think you're an out of towner with corona.

Yes I do. Your blanket statement I also disagree with. The idea that jobs is some finite resource is the same line of thinking leftists use when trying to explain why the wealth gap is an issue. There is finite wealth and somehow rich people having money means it was taken from a poor person. Here s an example. Illegal worker may be the cheapest but automation could be the next cheapest. There definitely can be situations where the job simply disappears.
I am in Arizona and worried we are going to go the same way. We are last in the country in testing. There is no telling how badly it has spread here. Our Governor only just ordered us to stay at home on Tuesday. but most businesses including my firm are deemed essential. Luckily I can work from home but I lose sleep worrying about my asthmatic partner and my overweight 65 year old father who survived pneumonia and a pulmonary embolism years ago.
A fantastic question Is it too soon to suggest abolishing the federal government altogether

So long as it's voluntary. But the minute a person is arrested for having a BBQ with a neighbor or a pastor is arrested for exercising his first amendment right to freedom of religion the government has gone too far. We had a guy arrested in Maryland for having a party and a pastor arrested in Florida for exercising their fundamental rights. Are those actions NOT tyrannical Nothing gives any level of government the right to suspend the 1st 2nd 4th or 5th Amendments. If compliance is voluntary we have no problem. People should stay home but not under threat of violence or a fine. Those are unconstitutional.

I particularly like the part that they bring their aggressive spirit to honor America' I particularly admire his wisdom in recognizing that selfishness is a bane to Americans.

You asked for an example and I gave you one. This isn't about people fooling anyone. This is about the LGBTQ crowd thinking that genderfluid means your penis can go in the ladies' locker room because you CHANGED the rules. Here's another one Saying that if a straight man won't sleep with a transwoman who still has a penis he's a transphobic bigot. You are literally demanding that straight people make themselves ENJOY SEX with folks who have the same genitals that they do or be called transphobic bigots.
Wow. No bias from you. And no it s not deflection. Trump did act early on and yes he downplayed it. But so did the democrats most republicans the entire MSM oh and the CDC and WHO.

Conservative but not a libertarian. There are so many things I care about for opening markets before I give even one shit that a company has to provide for Americans first. I can t even go sit down at a restaurant right now. Are you upset about that What about free markets Honestly I think the global economy is a failed experiment that would have been brilliant if it worked. But with all the restrictions we impose on our own companies we can t compete with places like China that not only send substandard stuff but who also don t hesitate to confiscate masks from American companies that operate there.
Crazy thing is if Hillary were president right now these fucks would never even realize how hard she'd be working to save their sorry lives. The immensely skilled pandemic response team that Trump scuttled would've been at full strength and snapped into action helping curtail most of the Covid threat before it even had a chance to leave Asia. All this death and suffering would have been avoided but since stopping pandemics doesn't make for sexy news stories very few Americans would realize what a horrible fate they'd just dodged and kept right on slagging Clinton for the usual bullshit reasons. But the rest of the world would've been grateful to America for stepping up to save it once again. But now under the fuckup in chief all I can muster for Americans is pity as I thank my lucky stars that I don't live there.

Actually no. This is the perfect time to talk about why having your healthcare tied to employment is a terrible idea. We're going into the worst pandemic in 100 years with the worst unemployment rate in 90 years. When massive numbers of unemployed folks start getting sick you can connect the dots.
That would mean only the very poor who have no investments or the very rich who can accept a poor rate of return for a few years could afford to be in government.

It wasn't an election year for pres at least When all is said and done we will all realize that none of this panic happens if there were not an election this November.
she is a strong female democratic leader and well liked of course sexist men like trump are going to consider her uppity and feel threatened by her when she issues lockdowns and factual statements that the president himself refuses to do. he s pathetic. she had nothing to do with this he has singled her out because of his own pathetic insecurities.
That's a false dichotomy. The death rate can be halved by a national stay at home order social distancing and quarantine of infected. That's it.

Even with how bad things look and the unemployment rate skyrocketing our GDP to Debt ratio is 91 at the moment down from 107 During the 1970s crisis it was anywhere from 31 to 40 and that wasn't close to the Great Depression.

I would guess the best thing to do is have the state governments take over and to move the national guard in each state to a state militia. Let the states then negotiate amongst themselves. Trump said he wants states to fend for themselves. I just think they won't really do it.

The man is exactly what a CO should be. I m boiling with how he was treated. I wasn t in the US Navy but I served in a navy and as a rating not an officer and had plenty occasions to dislike officers but never did I dislike a captain maybe I was lucky He did his f ing job and looked out for the welfare of his crew. And for him so what if he s fired He ll get a good well paid job elsewhere and his conscience will be intact knowing he acted in the finest traditions of the service. The video of him leaving the shop shows exactly that he did the right thing. If he leaked it himself fuck it I wouldn t hold it against him. And if he didn t it s a bigger injustice but it s done now. I bet if you asked him would he do anything different he d say no he wouldn t.
lol another very independent human saying reeee Very unique.
I fail to comprehend how anyone in this country could feverishly support this man. He has shown his lack of empathy towards common Americans almost every single day since he took office. Every publicity stunt from the Carrier Plant in Indiana all the way to his sudden disingenuous concern for Americans during this pandemic mere WEEKS after saying it was nothing. He s a corrupt piece of garbage Do people seriously still believe he s legitimately innocent of the crimes he was accused of Like seriously Since the Republican Senate decided he was innocent without witnesses or even a trial he has fired nearly everyone within the government that played a part in it. Innocent people don t do that.
They operate during all forms of weather danger etc. Has there been a period in which the tomb wasn t guarded Obviously I mean after it s construction being completed.
why would you give him this idea
Honestly no one should be blowing whistles in hospitals. Patients need their rest a doctor should know better than anyone. I don't mind people blowing whistles at home but have some respect for sick people.
Their comment makes nothing more likely to become an authoritarian dictatorship. Jesus Christ this thread.
She bought and sold on Jan 17 the meeting took place on Jan 24. Is there really a story here
They ll just assume the Democrats killed them.
Yeah you know the Chop Fluey
Yeah this guy is gonna get fired soon.
Good on the Canadians stand up to that piece of shit.
Yeh... I think I ll just move to Canada. Seems a fuck load easier than trying to logic a supporter.
Not sure if you heard this is a global pandemic
I should get reparations every time she says something. I left out the word stupid here intentionally.
They will fall the same way the Soviet Union eventually did. Total economic collapse. It will be slow and painful for them but inevitible.
There's a 99 chance that this is a conspiracy theory that Trump believes to be true. Or at least if presented to him he would claim to be true.
The part about his dad hiring a hooker to sleep with his brother in law and he secretly films it to blackmail his sister....WTF
She should go out and give every victim a big hug. Then go camping with Ivanka.
Because he's gayer than those at pride lol.
I believe if Trump didn t have his head up his ass and listened to his advisors who in 2019 were urging him to take preventive measures in order to help soften the blow of an inevitable virus like this. Bush ordered N95 masks to be held in the White House for something like this to happen all Trump had to do was listen
What friends we keep.
Pretty sure the President whoever it is doesn t have to authorize restocking of supplies. On the flip side he might tell them not to. Stuff like PPE gets rubber stamped all the time every day. The DoD would be completely inactive if they had to wait on Trump to sign off on expenses for every command.

Really focused on the pandemic I see. This really might be the end of the USA. Putin probably told him to use this crisis to consolidate power.
Until they actively promote violence nothing can be done. This has been going on since Reagan. The Republicans eagerly tell people they are not a reality based party. If you want to be grifted you are going to be grifted. If it wasn't the Republican Party it would be Alex Jones or Jim Baker or the next Jim Jones.
r moderatepolitics may be your cup of tea. They lean left but you better have proof.
No worries I bet they also think Obama is responsible for the fucked up Katrina response.
Yeah that moment really made her look ignorant. On the other hand she has made some very smart and educated points especially at the hearing on confronting white supremacy.
Not really. Less than 100 people only ever in dress uniform with cerimonial M 1's and M 14's Now if they regularly operated a tank or something then you'd have a more valid argument.
We are working towards change Leagl weed in a time of crisis Medecare for all in a time of health crisis Debt forgiveness in an economic crisis the other teams just want to sit and complain
I think 1 of 2 things should happen to government student loans. Either they should all be wiped away. Any government student loans that people have are immediately gone no matter the amount. Or if that is to crazy all government student loans are now 0 interest forever. Any interest paid in the past immediately goes towards the principle. No refund is given if you had more paid into interest than what is left on the loan. The amount of cash so many people would have after that would have a huge impact on the economy.
Yep. Still waiting to vote but that kind of inane both sides are the same Russian bullshit is not gonna convince me to vote for Sanders.

His facial expressions were perfect. Him not having a decrepit asshole for a mouth makes it less like trump but much better to watch and probably for him personally
As a Canadian I agree with this comment wholeheartedly and would just like to add. Fuck you all
Honestly I'm not going to completely disagree with you on that point. There are certainly going to be measures that the government is going to take during this time that the courts are going to look back at in a few months or years and agree that they government overstepped its bounds. You know what though It won't matter. You know what you should probably do Yell and scream and protest from self isolation. Fight for your rights. But do it is a responsible manner.
And now these dumb fucks have made it hard to get the drug I need for my Rheumatoid Arthritis.

That's a shame right We all have to do our part. Staying home saves lives. Too bad for those who lose their livelihood. They have to do their part too.
Whatevs
Nope. I will hold my nose and vote for a DNC puppet over Drumpf. Obvious choice. If we don't talk about DNC trickery and corruption designed to stop insurgent candidates like Bernie then we are doomed to continual War candidates. Who was the 1st and only Predident who was at war all 8 years he was in office. I make it easy he was also the first POTUS of color.
I've always wanted to move Iceland because of the views. That color base has always been my favorite.
What an absolute three ring shit show this has become. The fucking clowns couldn't be find their way out of a wet paper bag.
Does it matter The people have no power until the election and I'm not even sure if that's true. As long as the GOP still approves of him we're playing the try not to die game.
I think Trump is going to hear Maddow out on this one and really take a long look in the mirror and then change his ways.
1 3 million Do you know the author of that study has come out and said it was based on inaccurate mortality rate and R0 Why the fuck aren't you reading about the actual disease in the first place
So he knows as far as he can comprehend that this situation is dire and many will die. Yet he does nothing to give support to the nation. I'm curious how he wants to come way under the model. Also shocking that he talks about casualties soo casual. 0 empathy
Or... How about your license to vote is also your license to own a gun is also your license to freely travel and own property i.e every American is free to do all of the above with one document provided by the government.
Yeah let's pull our liberal tits out of the Republican's mouths. Let them figure out how to pull themselves up on their own bootstraps
Is that video real. That podium looks superimposed over the house background
Holy crap I m conservative but I m not gonna deliberately do something that helps spread a virus during a national emergency. I don t care if it s legal or not. Don t a stupid and practice social distancing. Your literal country needs it
That and with fewer border crossers that voter base will be reduced.

What type of ammo do you recommend for shooting viruses u Well Regulated Arms
Yes especially with the media doing all they can to lessen Pres. Trump s airtime and amp up the Orange Man Bad narrative they have been pushing for the past three years to even more ferocious heights.
No. I'm saying Joe has to earn my vote. Is that not how it works anymore Fuck off.
Isn t Trump a capitalist If 3M wants to sell elsewhere they have the right to do so
trumps the tip of the iceberg but these morons were sold an unsinkable economy with tax cuts.
Right I still have the same workload I had but now have to also teach my 8 and 11 yr old their classes cook and feed them lunch entertain them make sure they are getting exercise and the house gets messier with people in it non stop now instead of being gone most of the day so extra time is needed for cleaning too. I'm exhausted and my mom just keeps saying how rested and refreshed I must be with all this time at home
The masks are made from pulp only available in Canada vicnews.com America is lucky it's even being considered in this scenario.
gt I can t even go sit down at a restaurant right now. Are you upset about that What about free markets Again my complaint is with the FEDERAL government not with state and local authorities. And you're confusing why restaurants are closed with trump attempting to make 3M make just for the American market. gt I think the global economy is a failed experiment Did you send this from your Made in China iPhone or Android Are you willing to pay 10x the price for Made in America

gt Why not If your goal is to prevent hurricane deaths and you know that this is a particularly vulnerable group it would actually be a smart public health move to target interventions toward that group. because it's a silly way to approach the problem The fallacy with the argument I put forth is that the actual deterministic factor of being hit by a hurricane is living in Florida not being Cuban. Being Cuban just happens to correlate with living in Florida. Your argument is making that exact same mistake. The actual deterministic factor of having a negative outcome from COVID 19 infection is having an underlying condition. Race is correlated with income which is correlated with having an underlying condition. But there's no reason to base policy on race. Base it on underlying conditions which is the actual causal factor. Basing it on income would also be a much more coherent policy than basing it on race.
Nah. Pro funny. Lost art nowadays.
The US is at a later stage in the exposure graph though. Very few governments have handled the pandemic well but it's testament to how exceptional these circumstances are. What certainly made things much worse for the US is labelling it a Democrat hoax saying it will be over by Easter and taking forever to actually mobilise and take it seriously. They now have a far bigger domain for the infection curve to base itself on than if they had suppressed it earlier.
Oregon No

silicon valley needs world class people to remain on top not mediocre dumb dumbs. Honestly think you can take the average Trump supporter and train them to do the job
Yeah definitely doesn't wouldn't make sense something has to be done though. Data exists for each state so that could be figured out Im sure but there is such a road block it implementing changes across the US but it's possible. California raised theirs to 12 and some other states have raised theirs also. If a business can really not exist without paying workers a bare minimum to survive with basic needs met then it probably doesn't deserve to exist. If its essential then subsidies come into play they are already used so heavily across different industries. A good example is Walmart one of the richest families in the US and their employees are in poverty require food assistance have no healthcare. We are just subsidizing their exploitation every time some health issue gets ignored until it becomes an ER visit or for any food assistance they need.
gt If it betters the life of the individual With a better life it is confusing why they are always fucking totally outraged about non existent problems and then insisting on imposing their bullshit to solve the non problems
Oh man you ve swallows that 1619 kool aid by the gallon haven t you
universal singlepayer just transfers power from one big business to another. the difference is if the insurance companies didn't have monopoly type agreements with each other they would have an incentive to lower prices whereas the government does not. it's prone to bloat and offers terrible healthcare in return. healthcare done properly respects the economic freedom of the individual this is where leftists start to froth at the mouth in blind rage which means the people with the money the middle and working classes get to decide how to spend their money. incidentally this is where Trump's healthcare plan that he had Rand Paul draft free of outside lobbyist influence comes into play healthcare savings accounts forcing clinics to post procedure costs competition across state lines etc.
Maybe you're blinded by your search for a weak gotcha but this is consistent. The government has directly caused even mandated the joblessness. They are the issue
Zero valid points made
NYC running out of ventilators and hospital beds will happen with every other city if the virus can run rampant. A city being liberal or conservative is irrelevant for the spread.
We will. There's literally nothing he can do to stop us. Assuming for a moment that he does manage to stop elections when his term ends he's no longer the president and it would pass to Nancy Pelosi.
It'll be interesting to see him try. The presidency has an expiration date at least according to the constitution Even if we don't hold an election his term ends in January same with Pence. The Pelosi administration will be interesting.
Since no one officially dropped out neither should Sanders.
Nobody knew health care could be so complicated
I disagree. Enjoy your evening.
Quebec Have you seen a map of Manitoba This entire country is loaded with fresh water and our brothers and sisters to the south will require this to survive. Let s not use it as a bargaining chip...
Why the fuck are you even here go bitch on a Bernie sub. You all would gladly lap up any excuse to disarm the People and then when you find your liberties restricted what are you going to do Damn it's like you people want to live in China. I'm going to happily hold onto my guns here in the beautiful United States of America.
Back in my day we d call someone like that a cunt.
Leftists don t understand per capita and fail to acknowledge the US is doing far more testing and is far more honest in their modelling and stats. China s numbers are a complete lie.
No one was listening. No one was researching. No one was paying attention. That s the problem with an invisible enemy. That s the problem with a viral pandemic crisis. It wasn t happening. The states that left most of the decisions up to their people now have the hugest deaths and infection rate. That s what happens when your faced with a problem where 1 person can drastically mess shit up for 100 people.
Their paychecks keep coming and they just gave themselves a huge raise.
yup

gt The government absolutely has the right to tell people to stay at home to stop a highly contagious virus Governments don't have rights they have authorities. Learn what words mean before spewing your uneducated opinions everywhere.
This is dangerous. My 37 year old brother is in the hospital with covid along side his wife. He is in KY where he had to work security for churches that refused to close he s a police officer no preexisting condition just a previously healthy couple fighting for their life and we aren t allowed to see them. I hope you don t have a similar story in the next couple of weeks.
Bold of you to assume they have minds.
It's a private company they can do what they want.
Yes I probably agree. I was just making a point and throwing it out there for shits. And that is not where she is getting at with the mention of running for office I'm sure. Most likely a congressional seat.
There's a lot of reputable media in those images as well. I'm glad we can agree BuzzFeed is trash Do you have articles speaking to this clamor for a European travel ban I must have missed them. Everyone has this amazing 20 20 hindsight but I just haven't seen contemporaneous examples of that advice. I'd greatly appreciate them if you have them. Stay safe and healthy out there
Right. So the ribbon does have value. It s not just a symbolic thing. And their lives aren t in any real danger by pulling those stunts I would assume whatever they re driving over these IEDs with can take the brunt of it I sound like an idiot. I m just trying to get a sense of what s being said.
You know that conservatives want a trump monarchy
Ya'll been treading on peoples rights since long before all this.
I've always been poor I know how to get by. My trade ain't going nowhere. A second depression will be an inconvenience not life or death. However if this pandemic continues to spiral out of control illness could hurt me and my family.
The power of bullshit ia limitless. All this makes me hate the morons that have that money in the first place. A testament that most rich people are undeserving of their wealth.
Uh oh you know their serious when the Richard Nixon trope is pulled out.
I can 100 guarantee we will have one. Elections are a constitutional mandate and are run entirely by the states. There is nothing Trump can do to stop them.
It's gonna be fun
What the hell just days ago leftists were lambasting Trump for NOT using the DPA. Now he's supposed to just let is slide I know I know if Trump does X then X is bad. I got it.
I m in alaska. You re my best country friend.
There s a fundamental difference between a global pandemic that can overwhelm hospitals for months causing hundreds of thousands of deaths and having guns taken away. These situations are fundamentally different from one another. Please understand that.
So he didn't give any other reason to fire this guy except the fact that he was not 100 completely loyal to the current President and not the interest in the United States of America and our country's fair and free elections. Got it....
First order of business would be to check that they actually work. In fact might want to check them for polonium. Made in Russia pile of shit.

This was not him misspeaking. This is how the wealthy think about things

I thought that was satire
You guys aren't going have an election in November are you.
When the alot of the material of the masks in question comes from wait for it Canada yep better not fuck the hand that feeds you if you ask me
no they are fucking not lol
I mean I don t really understand valuing the economy over human lives. That doesn t feel partisan to me. There s already evidence that the virus kills a substantial amount of people when quarantines are not being implemented
Correct schooled. I was expecting exactly that. I guess He s a piece of unadulterated shit.
Ah yes you are correct I was looking at POTUS instead of realDonaldTrump
No shit. It s not enough for anyone
Like that kennedy center dems bailed out that still layed of their employees
So you're saying you're okay with Trump for another 4 years because you fear worry Biden won't hold bankers accountable Because Trump is less corrupt than Biden Or are you only saying this to stir up anger so people will vote for someone other than Biden
You can just look at the responses from the GoP and know he didn't get a hall pass. They were pissed.
He means billionaires himself and the people that keep him rich and influential.
TIL popular political post with lots of discussion is considered to be drama by 14 year old basement dwellers.
I wish I could believe that this was only satire. I remember vividly seeing a post in politics by a Bernie supporter that said instead of making the payment on my student loans this month I donated the money to Bernie s campaign. So this shit isn t far off. I d feel bad for the fact that they re all getting duped if they weren t actively trying to run our country off of a cliff.
I recently got dragged to fuck when I told a Bernie supporter that they are going to have to suck it up and vote for Biden no matter what. This was in a thread about the recent sexual assault allegations. Numerous people told me they will never vote for a rapist' Problem is by not voting they are implicitly casting a vote for Trump and if Trump isn't a worse sexual assaulter than Biden I'll eat my own poop. But it didn't matter they won't take responsibility. It made me momentarily furious with all of them and everyone like them. It's such a pathetic abdication of responsibility. Thousands of people will die under a Trump administration that wouldn't under a Biden one. No matter if Biden really IS a rapist no matter how addled his brain is. No matter what it says about America that old reactionary creeps are the only ones available to vote for. Thousands of lives. Tens of thousands quite likely. But people are going to ignore that and abstain from voting because they didn't get to vote for their preferred guy. It sickens me.
Not so. Eventually it will be down to seasonal flu level and or prevented by vacciene.
That's funny because right now there is no income.
I 100 fully expect Trump to postpone the elections or declare the results of the elections null and void. He pours hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars into his businesses and is without a doubt a Russian agent whom has a deep and corrupt history with the Russian mob. Republicans gave ZERO fucks about this and moderates normalized it until no one even fucking talks about it anymore. People will strike up a fury but in the end who's really going to stop them They haven't been stopped any other immoral or treasonous act from happening so what makes people think we're actually going to have a peaceful transfer of power
I m a reasonable person sure I m prone to hyperbole but I m fair. That whole goddamned administration needs to be put on a cruise ship and sent to sea in exile. The whole lot can rot in hell for eternity.

Also If you re monitoring QTc per the Cardiology guidelines for this drug or ISMP We aren t using high doses and I m seeing a 20 30 increase in QTc in the first 48 hours Thanks
The Trump Org has and based on the restructuring in 2012 amp 2015 yup dude was broke before the Primaries he s given a PERSONAL guarantee on the debts. Now since he s barred and so is his family from getting any of the latest loans and commercial real estate prices are crashing faster than he can lie DB are left with the choice of eating it or seeking recovery on a sitting POTUS. This is about to get really entertaining.
the rules were changed in hillary's favor not bernies. hillary's victory means nothing when she was playing outside the rules and with the help of the people running the election. it was more the kind of an election that a banana republic has it didn't matter. sure sure won an unfair and rigged election she definitely did that and she knew it hillary picked tim kaine for her vp who just happened the be the dnc chair before that and then when debbie wassermanshultz sp was booted out and forced to resign because she was cheating for hillary hillary gave her a job and started paying her from her campaign funds. corruption all the way down and not even ashamed of it
But this is Trump s idea about how the armed services should work. It s the way it works in the movies right What else do you have to know
gt Yes y all better vote blue no matter fucking who or y all are helping trump win. It s that simple. And yet when I say this I get down voted.
They ve done epidemiological studies showing what the effects would be if only the elderly and immunocompromised were to self quarantine and it s essentially the same result as if we did no form of social distancing or quarantining in place millions dead.
Maybe people finally got around to watching John Oliver.
So abortion clinics are still open Good. Going to the store to buy condoms Bad.
Trump supporters love to use GDP and job averages that include the terrible numbers from Obama's first year even though he clearly inherited an economy going down. It will be interesting to see if they are as rigid in evaluating Trump post coronavirus.

Not at all but the language I've been reading indicates that some might. I hope that's not the case but I have no idea how others are interpreting the severity of COVID 19. If it's just a political narrative to some then I question whether they understand the gravity of the situation.
And he's ugly just like his mom.
Trump said that there would only be 5 cases and that this would all be over by April. He also claimed that this was a democratic plot against his beautiful economy and that everyone who wanted a test would get one. If Pelosi has blood on her hands Trumps is bathing in blood.
They are going to vote for him no matter how many suffocate. Florida however They will be getting the first pick.

I made a reference to this being Romney s Thermopylae moment but your comment about the rule of law is so on point with what I was trying to convey.

Bernie supporters But I got to hold on to my ideals I can t vote for Biden screw it if MORE people die To the ones that can see the bigger picture thank you. I am sorry that Bernie isn t going to be the nominee. I hope I cam continue to fight for his ideals.
They haven't taken back bieber yet though...
I never really understood why cocaine is sometimes laced with fentanyl. Cutting it with flour or talc or whatever I see the obvious financial motive. But surely someone who's looking for cocaine would do the coke feel an opioid like effect I haven't consumed either class of drug but I believe opioids are more of a downer think this isn't coke and find a new dealer. Unless they also happened to be into fentanyl
The left cherry picks their causes. If a man wins over a woman in business politics etc. it's misogynistic. If a man dressed like a woman wins in athletics it's progressive. I wonder if President Trump showed up for a press briefing in drag then would the liberals embrace his policies and give him fair coverage I mean that makes as much sense as how they're handling it right now doesn't it This world is just messed up right now. Maybe we should turn back time to about 1960 for a do over.
This is anecdotal and it breaks my heart if it is true. This is a very tough time which is why it's vital for leaders to find ways to get resources to those who need them and know how to use them. If a second layer of problem has been added to the already overwhelmed system my condolences to the extra hard work that is putting on your wife and coworker. I'm not going to throw out one of those prays statements. The truth is... it's their daily hards work that is getting people through this. Theirs and the entire scientific and medical community.
Is that because you went from this subreddit to normal ones back to this one again you muppet
Bernie voters won't vote for fucking Bernie dude. Why the fuck should Biden count on their support
It won t be permanent economic ruin... but yeah it will be bad
Agreed. Plus arguing liberal views in here is like going to the RNC and pledging my delegates for enter token democrat here Not gonna work out well
As I understand it federal quarantine rules weren't invoked yet so it's all locally enforced with each state doing their thing. But yeah the feds could guard the state lines if they wanted to possibly threaten to quarantine a state if the state doesn't voluntarily do what they want.
The Fox News anchors right

If the media did not take it seriously it s not fair to expect the President to take it seriously. How could he have known
No evidence to support it so if there is little evidence is that the same as no evidence NYT article behind paid wall so pasting the interesting parts of the article i save it to pocket and then I can see the whole article The malaria drug hydroxychloroquine helped to speed the recovery of a small number of patients who were mildly ill from the coronavirus doctors in China reported this week. Cough fever and pneumonia went away faster and the disease seemed less likely to turn severe in people who received hydroxychloroquine than in a comparison group not given the drug. The authors of the report said that the medication was promising but that more research was needed to clarify how it might work in treating coronavirus disease and to determine the best way to use it. It s going to send a ripple of excitement out through the treating community said Dr. William Schaffner an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University.. The study was small and limited to patients who were mildly or moderately ill not severe cases. Like many reports about the coronavirus it was posted medrxiv.org at medRxiv an online server for medical articles before undergoing peer review by other researchers. The earlier reports from France and China drew criticism because they did not include control groups to compare treated versus untreated patients. Researchers called the reports anecdotal and said the lack of controls made it impossible to determine whether the drugs worked. nytimes.com nytimes.com
Now this is fascinating. I suppose it's better to articulate the real deaths of humans as a narrative so that you can mentally dismiss it easier or at the very least the death toll itself which is just data can be understood as a politicized narrative This is a fascinating way of thinking.
Donald Trump is a Russian asset.
gt If you can just tell me who we are supposed to hate that would be a big help. Since you're a leftist who posts in SandersForPresident you're supposed to hate anyone who isn't left of Marx.
Glad to have you
So...what reparations are they owed AOC and who pays I already know the answer to the second question the US tax payers mainly white people paying more money. As for what I know the ultimate answer nothing. Raising taxes taking money pandering to minorities but never actually delivering on those promises. The history of the Democratic Party. Honestly if it wasn't an election year I don't think you'd actually include black people in your statement. Reparations means war payments or at least it used to. Just another word ruined by the Left for the purposes of pandering. Now it is for COVID 19 victims before it was to blacks for slavery.
I dont.
Alright maybe not every single business is trying to make a profit but certainly a vast majority of them are I think that's fair to say. Look at almost every major coorporation in US history and you will absolutely find evidence of prioritizing profits over human life or good morals. Anyone who believes in the myth of the altruistic billion dollar coorporation is either working for a billion dollar company or a liar.

If the majority of people are uneducated poor etc and would vote for the Dems as your assumption follows then they should have a reduced opportunity to vote and not have representation seems to be the important point there.
Well yeah. He has no chance of winning your state so of course he hates it.
That is my thought but a lot of people have been lulled for a long time into work hard at your jobs and come home and be entertained. Obviously there are people that doesn't apply to like the real working class that have multiple jobs just to get by. The middle class though is pretty okay with being entertained as far as I can tell... A lot of the people I have talked to are just waiting for this to blow over.... it isn't going to blow over... We will see what happens. Good luck to you.

oh lol I literally just scrolled up to see what the first upvoted message in the thread was. Why would I have an alt Not everybody is that level of desperate mate. Just look at our post histories if you don't believe me. Or don't I don't give a shit. This is even better though because you could very tentatively make a claim that what was slightly troll y but my actual first comment was a robust explanation of why you being a dumbass for calling someone a leftist because they don't believe your conspiracy theory to which your IMMEDIATE response was to just keep calling me a leftist an accurate description of my political position like it's an insult and refusing to say anything interesting or worthwhile or engage in any of the rational debate that dipshits like you pretend to believe in until anybody actually starts talking to you when you shit yourself and run away.

You're missing any and all context apparently. More sentences followed that one. More random facts doesn't change how bad of a strategy repeated impeachment objectively is.
You dems just get more astonishingly ignorant by the hour.
No they weren't Issues that caused the 2008 crisis were never resolved and have resurfaced now. Corporate debt is at an all time high because of low interest rates causing high amounts of borrowing. Share price was rising drastically without an equal rise is actual value. We were due for this recession for a long time this virus just finally made the bubble pop.
That's not as much propaganda as it is criminal. Or psychotic.
Boil em mash em stick em in a stew.

I pray that doesn't happen to you neighbour. If there's one thing I learned from contracting H1N1 and barely surviving it even with a ventilator it's this viral pneumonia is an exceptionally shitty way to die.

At this point in time I will take WWIII before Trump as president for another 4 years...

In all seriousness I hope they launch their second wave of impeachment inquiries over this. This is even more exposed than the Russia collusion' fiction and the Ukraine aid withheld' narrative they invented. This is something that even a dead head low information rank and file' democrat voter will be able to understand.
SkyNet2024 because AI cant be worse than what we got
He was standing behind the Orange Oaf today when Trump was talking about hundreds of thousands dying and immediately makes a quick joke about having had sex with models I kid you not
You have zero insightful comments in your entire post history. You have got to be one of the dumbest people commenting on this sub.
I wish this was more surprising. I wish this wasn't so typical that we look at it and say oh just another person being replaced by Trump. How did we let this become the normal
Let's not stop the bleeding because we'll still have a stab wound afterwards
Reddit removed some of their mods because they were absolutely horrible people and also weren't doing their job properly. So they became convinced reddit was trying to put liberals into their mod team and locked up the subreddit and moved to their own website.
Let the free market do its thing. As long 3M didn t take any government funds let them do what ever they please. Plus it is in their incentive to sell to the American public since America is the largest economy in the world. Restrictions will just make the situation worse.
he's rich though. rich people always know what's best... for them
Even if it is true I see no problem with this.
Democrats control the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives counts the votes of the Electoral College. If Republicans refuse to pass mail in voting Democrats should just declare themselves the winner of the election regardless of the results.

Biden's got dementia of some sort and I'm fairly certain we need to really question the validity and sanity of a TWO PARTY SYSTEM of government both candidates being the corporate candidates.
chuckles retaliations hahaha
Inspired read brainwashed by massively funded disinformation campaigns that have been quite effective.
3M was taking bribes to delay American orders. It's fitting justice when the people paying the bribes get nothing.
It is already dead. We are in an autocracy pretending to be a democracy. You have the executive branch the DOJ and senate. That is all controlled by Trump. That leaves the house which can't do anything by itself. The DOJ has said Trump can do no wrong as long as he is president and the Senate agreed with Burr when they decided to let Trump stay in office. We are already there but don't realize it yet.
Agree. Only thing I think people forget is that it s not only old people. I am 23 and had a major DVT and pulmonary embolism a year ago that almost killed me. I have permanent lung damage from the pulmonary embolism and my doctor stressed to me that I really need to limit my exposure because I could very likely die if I get this and experience respiratory issues.
No it doesn t sound like that
Leaves room for negotiation. I prefer fuck no or no fucking way
The only hope is that this infection opens up the eyes of the independents and wishy washy Dems that votes Trump or stayed home or voted 3rd Party in 2016.
Funny you should say that. Did you know that most states consider churches as an essential business even though they don't pay taxes Easter is coming. Churches will be crowded. Historical Note The Black Death spread like wildfire throughout Europe as people crowded churches. This is one of the events that led to the Renaissance. This is a very dark way of looking at it but they are grown ups and have heard every doctor in the world telling them what to do. Elections have consequences as well as being a stubborn asshole.
Ridiculous
A lot of them are Russian and Chinazi bots they need to keep controlling the US and the Moron in Chief is perfect for that. Funny thing I really like Sanders but dislike a lot of his followers

I hope those of you threatening to sit out the next election because your candidate didn't get the nomination are paying close attention. If he's willing to do shit like this in the middle of a pandemic in the months leading up to the election imagine the shit he'd do if he was reelected.

How about if you don't want to get it YOU stay home. Take responsibility for your own actions and not force everyone else to comply with your personal wishes on threat of imprisonment or death
Pretty much. News has always been interpretation through lens vs. what actually happened but it's more apparent than ever today.

I promise you they don t see millions dead that projection was utter bullshit.
That's the point I was trying to make. The captain was obviously able to get in touch with all the generals no way there could be a communications breakdown
Trump is an existential threat to all of us. I'm not trying to lecture you on ideology I was just explaining why some people do what they do in more generous terms than because they're idiots or whatever. There's a lot of people out there who feel like Biden is also an existential threat for them and though Trump may be a larger threat not all of these people appreciate feeling coerced into putting their name behind the smaller threat. Instead of turning on these people we should be putting more pressure on the DNC to actually represent them.
Ok how do we shut him off
He did learn his lesson. It is just that the lesson was you can do whatever you want. We won't stop you or even hold you the slightest bit accountable and your voters will love you even more regardless of what you do.
Convicted felon here. Your assessment is completely correct. I understand that most people want to take advantage of a system the would benefit them more. Which is why I try not to get upset with the people taking those advantages but clearly the system is to blame for making it even an option for felons or illegal immigrants or just immigrants to get privileges that law abiding natural citizens don't have. Many democrats want to make sure people like myself get the right to vote even while incarcerated want to have much more lenient punishments for the crimes being committed and have even worked towards making pedophiles which even most of the other prison population hates and wants to hurt kill into a protected population. Yes you read that correctly. While in prison in Minnesota I learned it is a hate crime to assult one of the pedophiles and that they even are placed into protective units if they feel threatened. Now as a felon it might make sense if I wanted more advantages for me to vote democratically. I am a conservative though. I broke the damn law and there is punishment and personal responsibility to be observed no if ands or buts about it. I believe in reforming inmates which you sure as hell can't do if you tell them everything is society's fault like the democrats have been touting for years. I'm sure the ego centric sociopaths won't find a way to incorporate that into their violent ideologies at all. I apologize for the long rant there this is something that bothers me a lot. Republican and conservative individuals saved me from that life through kindness sternness and showing me I had the ability to change myself by taking action.
No the argument for this like all the you can't go to work church or anywhere else just about is To keep you who bear no symptoms from unknowingly potentially infecting someone with a virus they may or may not die from...

I don t really have the time to go through these to discuss with you but I do appreciate the polite dialog. I m not sure what position you are trying to take and that s ok because you chose to come to me with logic and discussion and not insults.
Fantastic username
How does it effect you
I mean what are we gonna do to stop him Impeach him That'll go good again. Especially right now.
I agree a blanket nation wide policy is not the answer. We equate lives to dollars every day and have been doing it as a society for centuries. Every public policy is based on that. Studies and statistics have shown that having two officers in a patrol car decreases the chance of an officer dying. However budgets dictate that one is more economical. So yes we equate lives with money all the time.
You want the guy who fucked up an aids outbreak to remove the guy who fucked up a covid outbreak
I think you're actually right and k10s isn't tied to n95 manufacturing. But it IS critical in the supply chain for other medical supplies like surgeons masks. Not just oil filters and I think the point stands selfishly choking off some of the supply chain is a shortsighted move. 3M's response is worth reading. news.3m.com They draw the same conclusion about this ultimately impacting the availability of masks. So fine. You're right. About the wrong topic though...

You're dodging everything I've said because you know it's uncomfortable to think about. You know killing people is wrong so the twisted ideology people are feeding you is giving you issues. That's ok. It takes people a while to learn that their beliefs are wrong. That's part of the human condition. I just hope you keep thinking about what you believe and why you believe it. Keep asking yourself why a biological human only becomes human after a few weeks even though biologically they vary. Ask yourself why you think it's a right to kill someone and why it stops at a un certain age.
I didn't know that not liking gays was not conservative
The 1000 ventilators that were sent to California were broken all of them so no you cannot trust this administration to act quickly or in good faith. If a state needs the venitlators tomorrow this administration has demonstrated that they simply cannot be trusted or relied upon at all. Not one bit. You are giving this administration undeserved faith they have exhausted all of the good faith we had left in them long ago and anyone still thinking give them a chance has really been asleep.

Based on how Florida's Unemployment system is working and I imagine many other states as well this is beyond an inconvenience. We are looking at 10 30 of our working age people soon out of work and potentially with no money coming in because the states are not prepared and have broken their unemployment systems so much to the point that NO ONE is getting approved. This is creating a powder keg.

Lots of people hook up with models Mr. President. It's just that they don't have to pay for them before during or after.
I ve talked to some friends that are trump supporters and they still love him after this whole mess he s caused. It s really sad that he has such a strong cult. I do believe we will get some changes. Probably more sick leave for employees and better work life balance with people being able to work more from home. Maybe wages might go up. But i could see a downside where they have to cut more stuff because we will be in bigger debt.

Any attention is good attention to a narcissist. Positive or negative he relishes in it. Everything he does is meant to maximize attention. Once you view everything he does through that lense it becomes very easy to understand how his mind works.
He said he doesn't support it because when people have an easier time voting republicans have a harder time winning...I don't think he can do anything to stop states from implementing it. Could be wrong about that.
John Locke not James Locke.
omg. My takeaway here us that Trump innocently said The professionals did the models and his mind heard him say that and went straight to mmm I'd love to do a model and he blurted it out. He simply cannot help himself.
thats a terrible analogy as it continues the idea that someone good at business is good for government. there is a very distinct difference between running a country and a business and continuing to make the comparable is the worst thing we can do.
That's fair and why I am supportive of subsidies like we have now. It's better to subsidize Americans instead of immigrant labor. But I want us to transition away from foreign labour to farm in the national. Whether we hire more americans or use machinery and new technology.

Come to Michigan Georgia Washington or others. Read the articles I attached. Search for your own. You will get the same results. This has been an issue for quite some time. Perhaps every single farmer is lying. I doubt it though. We're talking over a million dollars worth of fruit that would die on the vine. There is a dearth of migrant workers due to visa issue so there is no excuse. They should be flooded with folks seeking work. We have similar problems up here. The work ethic drought is real among our entitled folks too.
I know right. If someone offered them a Visa to live here you know what they would do.
Untrue. 75K means different things depending on your location. I'm in Chicago make a little more than that and my rent and cost of living gas normally food prices is super high. If I lost my job I would for sure need something like this.
I actually can admit when I am wrong. Debates and discussions are interesting and I am always learning. Like a lot of people I don't quite know what to think about all of this. And I definitely don't know everything there is to know. I just can't say my rights are worth more than someone else's life. I hope and pray that we have more accurate testing to know who has this or has had it and we can improve treatment options. Soon. Because we all have to get back to work.
In the big picture the 1860 Census census.gov counted a total of 31 443 321 people of which 3 953 760 were slaves. So slaves accounted for 12. 6 percent of the national population.

Households are a broader category than families. amp x200B So even by 1860 when slavery had 100 more years to become even more entrenched in daily American life than it already was less than 5 of people in the South owned slaves according to politifact.com politifact.com amp x200B So.... wow you're wrong already right off the bat. And no I don't see where you're going. amp x200B There is no official state sponsored religion no. But it was founded by Christian people on Christian principles. That is not the same thing. That is people using what they know to form the basis and continuation of the new government.

Interesting suggestion and would like to hear more. What about the extremely high volume of those individuals considered high risk groups that live with among the general population. How do we effectively isolate distance them. Unless you suggest that everyone over 65 live in a separate building town from the rest of the world. The virus sits very effectively in asymptomatic carriers and spreads just as easily i m not sure how I could possibly practice social distancing in a home where you may share a bathroom food and general amenities with my grandparents. Not antagonizing just hoping to better understand the nature of your solution. My understanding is that citizens going back to work en masse will no doubt spread the virus more rampantly which I hope we agree on that point. Subsequent to that the high risk groups we inevitably live with among are in turn at a much higher risk of contracting the virus. I agree if there was some mechanism of isolating all people over 65 in aggregate within a bubble distanced from the world that this may theoretically work. But i m not sure how to achieve that.

I would love to see some proof before making accusations... The original article didn't cite a single source
He sent this up the chain of command he just broadcasted it out far enough someone leaked it because they thought he wasn t getting traction. The fact it hurt Trump is just gravy for the majority of the military that can t stand him.

If you can t admit that Bernie Sanders takes large donations you re part of the problem in American civil discourse. The amount of time and effort it takes to get you guys to acknowledge basic facts that are inconvenient to your narrative is insane and fundamentally not progressive.

How long before the rest of the country begins to consider AOC as the mindless contrarian who objects to everything unless it gets her everything she wants Even in real life you have to make compromises and you have to make trade offs. You don't get everything you want at the same time. Most people understand this. I think we're fast approaching a time when AOC will complain about something and most people will just say Yep that's the token resistance from that socialist lunatic. She's talking herself into unimportance.

I watch Trump press briefings in their entirety everyday. He does not sound presidential. His thoughts are incoherent. His rants veer off randomly into ridiculous tangents and he has the lexicon of a 9th grader. Frankly he sounds like a complete idiot whenever he speaks and I'm utterly shocked by the amount of people who hold his style in high esteem. His rhetoric however lacking in sophistication is demonstrably effective and that is probably the most troubling aspect of his press briefings. I'm sure social scientists and historians will be analyzing it for many years to come.
His jealousy of big brother may have gotten the better of him.

This is a FALSE equivalency. It's perfectly possible to have the virus and not spread it even if you're going out in public. It's also perfectly possible for other people to avoid getting the virus from an infected person even if they're in close proximity.
because then young people would be able to vote instead of needing to stand in line for 6 10 hours

her name is governor whitmer and LIKE TRUMP ALWAYS DOES he decided to feud with her for literally no reason other than that he is a petulant child who needs an enemy. governor whitmer has been standing up for the people of michigan and saying what the people of michigan need and what the facts are as it is her duty to do. she is a strong female leader and a well liked democrat and that makes trump s head explode so he is refusing to send supplies and disrespecting her on twitter. he is a fucking child and does not care who dies because of his inaction.
Keyboard anger. So real its sad.
All those cuts to our education system and general stupidity.
This virus really can't be stopped. Almost everyone is going to get it. However we need that spread to happen in a slow and controlled manner with the proper drugs to limit the damage and older people need to be kept away from it.
I am sure the 2nd in command took over. I am pretty sure he we return command if asked and not complain at all.

Absolutely right.
History is written by the victors and while the world as a whole will know for all time that trump was the worst we had to show what I fear is we don't steer the ship and before we know it we raise another generation on textbooks that avoid trump's transgressions and either speak praise of him or avoid the subject entirely just like our education already does on many many wrongdoings of our country over its history

Yes Snopes did debunk that. I didn't say Trump called the virus a hoax I said what Trump said he said that he was calling the Democrats response to his response to the virus a hoax. Trump was very clear on multiple occasions that he thought that he had everything perfectly under control and that nothing could go wrong with the virus. Edit That's why I used the complete address he made on the matter in it's entire context. Like come the fuck on. How is Trump's words word for word and in it's full context a misrepresentation of what he said. Trump failed to listen to anyone criticizing him telling him he could do more and then sat on his hands while telling everyone that there wasn't anything to worry about because he was doing a great job

Having a president who gives rambling off the cuff answers is the opposite of refreshing. If someone is rambling off the cuff they are typically perceived to be incoherent. It's easy to take his words out of context because it's so difficult to figure what the context is and that is a direct result of his rambling. He's transparently an idiot. Americans shouldn't have to decode the President's words. It is assumed he is saying what he means. Apparently not anymore. Also if he's so transparent then why does his adminstration fight transparency. Exhibit A Trump stated during the bailout bill signing ceremony that he will not honor the transparency clause pertaining to Mnuchin dustributing funds to business. Refusing to tell anyone where billions of public tax dollars are being distributed is LITERALLY the opposite of transparency.

You all still going to church Yea. You re already infected. Before the major outbreak happened in the us there was a party of 40 people in Westport CT. One town over from me. One person was at that party. 1 week later those 40 people spread the virus across Fairfield County CT and into Westchester county NY. It spreads like fucking wildfire. Their stay at home isolation is no joke and every state should be doing it.

For women this is a big fight. It is not just sports. They are putting male rapists in women's jails and defunding rape shelters who only allow females. The sports is just one aspect of a assault on sex based rights that affects everyone but especially women and girls and the children who are taking this ideology in and thinking that they too are trans. There has been a 4000 increase in referrals to gender clinics in England can't find the statistics for America but it has to be similar and any studies into the social contagion aspect of what they call rapid onset gender dysphoria are being shut down by trans activists and not allowed to go on. This ideology is a BIG problem for society.

The voter ID card system in India is good but it too is being misused. India's left is even more deranged than the american left they have actively produced these same voter id cards for illegal aliens crossing over from bangladesh in return for their votes these illegals are all muslims and will always vote for the left Prime minister Modi is interested in creating a national register of citizens so India can know who its actual citizens are and the Indian left and American MSM refer to him as a hindu nationalist and a fascist for it. Letting illegals into the country and letting illegals vote appears to be something leftists have in common no matter where in the world they are.

Bingo He has a list of these news cycle changing actions he can take that do actually accomplish objectives that they are after Trump is retaliating against career public servants and he needs to be held accountable but lets get back to making him account for all the lives being lost to covid19.
Maybe he saw the virus name SARS COV2 and assumed the old SARS tests would still work He's not exactly the brightest bulb in the tanning bed so that wouldn't surprise me.

I thought that declaring a National Emergency allowed for the temporary suspension of some rights. I mean it's one step below Marsh Law isn't it The stay at home and no crowds larger than 10 fly in the face of the Constitution. But people are doing it. For public safety we are willing to forego our right to assemble...for now. I'd have to look a bit deep but I'm guessing there are several of the first ten that could be suspended constitutional during this or other crisis. Isn't San Francisco under a night time curfew I may have missed it but I don't remember much talk about that when it happening. Of course it is San Francisco and who really cares about Nancy's home town My thinking We don't want any rights suspended. But we are willing to let it happen in a situation like this. I mean anyone been to Walmart lately Only one entrance in use no paper towels toilet paper or eggs. Are chickens social distancing from their laying cages Milk is plentiful but going up in price. I thought with many just buying what they needed now the binge buying is supposed to be over now the basic items would be in stock right But today Florida started with the stay at home shit. Most are doing it. There are no large gatherings or riots going on. No groups at the open gun shops and ranges holding signs saying From My Cold Dead Hand.
Some are paid under the table others are given fake names IDs and get their Income Tax withheld just like everyone else. Plus they all buy food and gas and clothes. So they all pay Sales Tax.
I don't see why it's any different from a company selling fish or wood or any other natural resource. You're paying for the packaging processing and distribution.

Hello fellow Left Winger I support the existence of the 2nd amendment and there are very few people in American politics trying to take our guns away Yes politicians are often misinformed about firearm related issues because most don't own or haven't used one so they use the wrong terms and sound dumb to someone who's informed when they're on the podium trying to appeal to the masses after a bunch of kids get shot. But the actual push recently for controlling firearms has been strengthening background checks and ending secondary markets. If that proposal scares you so much that you won't get out of bed to at the very least oppose the alternative then you're part of the problem.
It is Friday isn't it strange
Aren't you the one conflating a specific libertarian principle with conservatism Ironically the defense production act was created to combat the spread of communism gt Truman had been involved in defense production during the previous war chairing a special committee that exposed abuses and waste in war production. Now faced with the prospect of a massive well organized enemy he requested the authority to oversee another economic mobilization. In September 1950 Congress passed the Defense Production Act.
Right now I honestly dont have the time for a 30 minute video I watched a few minutes and already it had some glaring errors. At 1 minute in he talks about failed communist regimes but calls it socialism which it is not. He then mentions places which aren't communist regimes but are socialist countries but says this doesn't count and socialists just want to take credit for... socialist systems working If you could provide some written sources I'm in a better position to read those but I think you will find almost the entire world agrees Hitler was right wing. I understand you are right wing that's okay. What isn't okay is lying about history to help protect what you see as your side

I'm just referring to the UDHR which does not explicitly mention guns or other weapons at all. It talks about a right to shelter and a right to life but it doesn't speak about one's right to defend these rights through gun ownership. Look I'm not necessarily anti gun in most contexts I just was pointing out that according to the most widespread albeit flawed global agreement regarding human rights guns don't rate a mention. If you want to extrapolate those rights to include guns well that's going to be pretty controversial. I fully respect that the US constitution has the second amendment and therefore does enshrine that right for its citizens it's just a reminder that Human' does not necessarily equal American' Many other very democratic countries have rights and liberties but do not include gun ownership.
Never said he was a decision maker. But any idea that the average military man hates Trump and would stand up to him in any capacity is a pure fantasy.

gt gt gt When President Trump battled impeachment early this year his reelection campaign staff blasted out Facebook ads texts and emails to donors and supporters arguing that he was delivering gonzo job figures and a soaring stock market in the face of bitter partisan obstruction. gt gt Those ads drew Trump s highest audiences on Facebook his campaign s chief advertising platform which it has used to test out thousands of messages and images since the 2016 election. gt gt Now with the nation s economy reeling more than 10 million Americans out of work and the stock market plummeting 30 Trump and his aides are struggling to find a new message he can take to Americans for the November election. gt gt Five weeks ago it was all going to be about this amazing economic machine that we had built said Stephen Moore a former economic advisor to Trump s 2016 campaign who remains in contact with the White House. It seems like 100 years ago. gt gt So far at least Trump s campaign has not directly mentioned the COVID 19 pandemic in its Facebook ads. It is test marketing a handful of ads that only vaguely allude to it casting Trump as a unifying leader for a nation facing uncharted territory. One says Trump is uniquely suited to keep the country SAFE. gt gt Whether voters agree with that argument and how they view his competence in battling the coronavirus outbreak and reviving the ravaged economy likely will determine his political fate overwhelming other judgments about his rocky tenure in office. Polls show he faces widespread concern that he mismanaged the government s early response. gt gt After weeks of downplaying the coronavirus crisis Trump cast himself as a wartime president in mid March recommended drastic social distancing measures and signed the country s largest ever stimulus package. During his nightly news conferences he went from rosy projections of a quick turnaround to grim faced warnings of 100 000 to 240 000 American deaths and a deep economic recession if not worse. gt gt Larry Kudlow Trump s top economic advisor said Friday that the 10 million jobless claims filed in the last two weeks don t fully reflect the economic pain. Kudlow who had spent weeks suggesting the stock market crash offered investors a chance to buy on the cheap conceded that hardships will get worse before they get better. gt gt In response to another bleak jobs report Friday Trump s campaign promised relief for small businesses and workers in the 2 trillion stimulus bill passed by Congress even though the initial rollout of 350 billion in loans for small businesses was mired in confusion and delays. gt gt It also accused former Vice President Joe Biden the likely Democratic presidential nominee of useless partisan sniping from the sidelines. Since the crises worsened Biden has been forced to run his campaign from the basement of his home in Wilmington Del. gt gt Biden s campaign called Friday s job report which said the economy shed 701 000 jobs in March sending the unemployment rate to its sharpest one month rise since 1975 a flashing red light and said that Trump needs to push another stimulus package to stop the economic bleeding. gt gt Other red lights are flashing for Trump s campaign however. gt gt After embracing national guidelines for social distancing in mid March Trump s approval ratings for his handling of the crisis began to climb. But a poll released Friday by ABC News and Ipsos showed a decline from 55 three weeks ago to 47 gt gt Several governors especially those who issued stringent stay at home orders saw their poll numbers jump. gt gt Governors have been seen as more clear and decisive about their actions and they ve gotten a lot of credit said Charles Franklin who conducts a monthly tracking poll for Marquette University in Wisconsin a crucial state for Trump s reelection campaign. Trump has been less consistent in his rhetoric about how we should think about the crisis but the consequences of those actions are less clear. gt gt Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers a Democrat wins high marks for his handling of the epidemic from three quarters of the state s voters for example. Trump s handling rates well with just over half of Wisconsin voters according to Franklin s poll. gt gt Some of that difference may be the result of Trump s divisive rhetoric which has helped the president maintain a solid core of support but has prevented him from winning over Democrats and independents throughout his presidency. gt gt Attitudes about the president are deeply ingrained both positive and negative said Whit Ayres a Republican pollster. So there is a powerful tendency to view the president s performance through the preexisting lens. gt gt Trump has done best in polling when he has spoken realistically about the threat as when he introduced the social distancing guidelines last month and when he extended them last Monday until April 30 with a painful assessment of the potential death toll. gt gt The more his briefings are like Sgt. Joe Friday just the facts the stronger he is said Neil Newhouse a Republican pollster a reference to the old Dragnet series. gt gt My advice is to be realistic to describe things as they are not as a salesman and the more realistic he is the more reassuring he can be said Ari Fleischer former press secretary for President George W. Bush. If there s a problem point it out in a nonaccusatory manner and explain how you re going to fix it. gt gt Trump has done that on rare occasions. But in many tweets and public appearances he has lashed out at governors for demanding too much and not being appreciative enough even as their hospitals and morgues overflow and suggested he might divert resources to those who say nice things about him. gt gt He has denied responsibility for widespread testing problems falsely insisting any American who wanted a test could get one. And instead of using his authority to coordinate a unified response he had told states to solve their own supply problems leading to a Darwinian fight for test kits ventilators masks and other critically needed medical gear. gt gt Some Republicans believe voters will forgive or forget Trump s many statements downplaying the danger his boasts that infections were under control and his repeated claims as recently as a week ago that COVID 19 the disease caused by the virus was no worse than the flu. gt gt Both Biden s campaign and Priorities USA the main Democratic super PAC have launched TV and digital ads in swing states featuring Trump s early expressions of nonchalance about the coronavirus. gt gt Tim Miller a Republican strategist who worked on former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush s failed 2016 presidential campaign and has become a vocal critic of Trump said Democrats can argue that Trump not only dismissed the danger with his rhetoric but also failed to act swiftly enough on the information he had. gt gt The timeline here is critical because this is such a slow moving disaster Miller said. There s this flattening of time with us all stuck in our homes and people are open to the idea that everyone was caught by surprise and came to it late and that s not the case. gt gt He cited a Feb. 5 tweet from Sen. Christopher Murphy D Conn. who concluded after leaving an administration briefing that Trump s team isn t taking this seriously enough. gt gt There has to be no mistaking the fact that the Trump administration knew this was coming knew enough to brief the Hill and yet the president failed to act when it would have really mattered Miller said. The Democrats challenge is making this as clear as possible and it s a lot harder politically than just clouding things up and making it seem like everyone is just as guilty as he is. gt

Which fucking baffles me. I m a former officer. Military folks of all ranks bitch endlessly about their shit leadership. The same adjectives and descriptions they use they excuse this guy from. What they admire as his leadership qualities they d crucify their commander for. This man is what they typify as a leader He doesn t use his natural abilities to inspire people to follow him. He coerces loyalty with fear and intimidation. He doesn t let his achievements speak for themselves instead he has to tell you how great he is. The man is fucking incapable or unwilling to admit mistakes and defer to experts. He never listens. Only talks. My years as a battery level officer taught me that the defining quality of a leader is the ability to accentuate your talents while admitting your weaknesses. The people you are charged with know you don t know everything and you come off as a tool when you try to appear as though you do. A person is a leader not because they know everything but because they know how to think. This piece of shit tries to present himself as an expert on everything. The only thing he does right is protects what he does wrong. I knew many leaders just like him they were incompetent and their units were shitshows. Paranoid career worlds where a good idea out of step with the man in charge would more likely land you at parade rest than on an award citation. It was never about what actually was accomplished only how the boss looked. Every service member that gloats of their support for this garbage person has completely missed the fucking point of every training exercise they ve ever participated in.

I m not American and it seems very bizarre to me that your federal government appears to be purposefully holding stockpiled medical equipment and saying that it s a federal stockpile not a state stockpile. So what the heck is it for then If it s not for supporting individual states wherr is it supposed to go Where else do Americans live

This I'm pretty damn sure everybody left or right hates the Patriot Act. It's long due to go away... but the government doesn't want to relinquish those powers. And it somehow keeps on getting extended and renewed. The analogy is so freaking applicable but people are so terrified that they just want the promise of security. Like I said... Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin would be ashamed of us as a society.
NUH UH NO THEY CANT Yeah it's that easy.
I thought gatherings of less than 10 or 5 or something like that were still OK My cousin s wife was bitching the other day because her neighbor had three or four visitors over and she knows because she can see her neighbor s house from her home office. That s a private residence and I draw the line at getting to dictate what someone does in their home unless it s a loud party that violates a stay at home order. But having two friends over and you re whining about wanting more restrictions Nah. I think by now everyone knows you shouldn t be going to huge parties but some people want more police enforcement just for people talking to their neighbors or buying non essentials.
It's such a ridiculous cutoff. It's hard to complain about because if you general you not you specifically complain about making too much money for the bailout you kind of sound like a dick to people who make less money and are struggling more. But the cutoff is way too low. If you provide for a large family or live in an area with a high cost of living 100k really isn't much. 250 000 at least would be a better cutoff.
How Can you give specific examples on how I am ill informed. Or are you just going to be dismissive of me because you do not agree with me. Please tell me how 6 000 plus deaths is fine. This is not orange man bad I would like to know why you think this is an acceptable response. You said that it s ok for the president to use legislation that is meant for wartimes. If this wasn t that bad do you think we would be using the defense production act Or are you just going to stick your head in the sand

One of the few times I very much disagree with trumps decision here. Nothing good will come from this you will just start a trade war and everyone will lose even worse.
Fake news
He's making war on the people.
The number of ICU beds is not a statistical model. It is a fixed number. The article does not mention the finite supply of hospital resources hence my issue with it. The shutdowns are not to reduce the number of people contracting the virus it s to lengthen the time it takes for new cases to spike and thus allowing our Goodyear resources to keep up.

I guess I'm not sure how the argument applies more broadly to all farm labor because guest workers legal and illegal are used extensively. The one argument I'm mostly OK with is that having a domestic food supply is critical for national security so we subsidize otherwise failing enterprises.

Truth
Ignoring Biden because not even Democrat s are enthused about him do you think that Trump regularly tells the truth I m genuinely curious
They are all angry that Hillary didn t win that was the original plan. Hillary wins and continues to gut the middle class to fund integration into the world. Not to mention all the other shit she would have allowed to happen. Trump derailed everything.
What s surreal is expecting someone to try and benefit from the pandemic but it s the president and I feel like I could do better than him. Like I could probably get away with more money and it would be less obvious. It s not the evil part anyone could do that. It s the unique quality of the stupid.

gt BIDEN IS NOT AND WILL NEVER DO THIS SHIT THAT TRUMP IS DOING I'm not convinced. Yeah Trump sucks but I truly think Biden is worse. He is easily the worst candidate in my lifetime. He's worse than Romney worse than Hillary and even worse than Sara Palin. Normally when a candidate wins the primary the winner will adopt some of the 2nd place finisher's policies to win over the 2nd place finisher's supporters. Biden is not doing this at all. He is giving a gigantic middle finger to all Bernie supporters. We're told to vote blue no matter who as a threat. Fuck that. If Biden did anything to win my vote then I'll vote for him but he clearly feels like he doesn't have to do anything. I'm supposed to just vote for some senile clown because he has a D next to his name and he isn't Trump. Fuck that. Fuck Joe Biden.

When in doubt blame the black guy.
I don't doubt a 200k total death toll at all. CDC official estimate of the flu death toll is 12 61k people per year and the coronavirus has a higher mortality rate and also we have no vaccines for it. I'm guessing that it's gonna kill at least 100k people this year and then in subsequent years as people develop immunity we get vaccines going that annual number will drop off.
gt But sitting here watching Trump do nothing while experts and news are accused of trying to create a panic the death toll rise while Trump continues to do nothing and his followers singing his praises in spite of the fact that he's done literally everything wrong makes some part of you want more I get what you're saying but Trump absolutely can't win. If we let him win then it will prove to him that he will never have to worry about repercussions. He will be completely unrestrained without fear of political or legal consequences. So you're feeling defeated. Ok. Let's look at this Trump won in 2016 because Dems didn't show up..That s frustrating. But just look at what has happened since the Dems won some truly shocking special elections. They did amazingly well in the midterms. Turnout is up and opposition to Trump is high. The only way we lose is when we don't show up. Theres no reason to succumb to defeatism. Trump won once but once isn't a pattern. If we let him win again then it becomes a commentary us. But if we flood the polls and truly kick his ass then his original election was just a fluke. A stroke of bad luck brought on by just the right mixture of over confidence and apathy. We get to decide how history views 2016. We have one last chance to unfuck this situation.
Real shock news TRUMP TELLS TRUTH world shudders in alarm shock horror hah not going to happen.

I appreciate the comment. In his announcement he said it's shown very very encouraging early results and it's approved and immediately available for prescription because it has tremendous promise Here's the relevant part of the interview youtu.be Hydroxycloriquine stocks dried up almost immediately after that. It hadn't been approved for coronavirus but doctors were still able to Rx it for off label use. So while he didn't literally say it's the wonder drug that's going to beat coronavirus he may as well have. I do hope that it ends up proving to be a viable treatment and combining it with azithromycin show fantastic results but I hope no one dies from the very low LD50 of the drug or is permanently affected by the other side effects I mentioned.

What plans would those be from the Democrats The areas getting hit the hardest are the ones run by the Democrats. The Democrats were the ones back in January and February telling everyone not to worry and use the subways and go to the lunar New Years and Mardi Gras celebrations while this virus was out there spreading like wildfire. Meanwhile we have the Governor of California a Democrat obviously saying this is a prime opportunity to usher in a progressive era and you have Democrats in Congress that are trying to delay the relief efforts in order to load them up with Lefty pipe dreams that have nothing to do with combating this disease or helping people make it through this period of economic disarray which will have a far greater impact on all of us than the virus itself will ever have. Meanwhile the President shut down travel from China back in January has been having daily briefings authorized wartime style production orders and the response from the Democrats and the media was to just use the same old and tired labels of he s racist stupid evil all the while acting as China s propaganda machine here in the US.

Because this issue COVID19 is over exacerbating the hospitals capacity to care for these people who need certain treatment. It s like comparing apples to oranges... obviously heart disease is a huge problem in the US number one killer but because there aren t multitudes if people dying all at once within a specific timeframe and thus making it hard for healthcare workers to do their job we take precedence over the recent virus. I don t get how people don t see that.
The US will also dwarf the world in death tolls.
Fuck... I guess I'll just dump my shit.
Here's a tweet by Republican Rand Paul responding to Politico's examination of the documents in question. twitter.com Since Rand Paul is taking the reporting of a source like Politico seriously I'm inclined to believe that he examined the claims about the documents via his own sources and found it credible. politico.com Here's also a pretty good piece by The Hill on the issue of American history on the issue. thehill.com

Ad hominem in lieu of discourse is not the best idea on any platform.
She dropped out.
This article doesn't say anything about blaming Trump. And you're deflecting what he said by lambasting the effectiveness of stockpiling goods. If you support states' rights you should be irritated that the federal government has a stockpile that they are unwilling to send to the states where you know Americans live. It's ok to say something critical about an administration that you generally support.
I know a pollster. Her name is Marge Inovera
Virulence of the disease is not known since we have never tested an entire population. The only contained population that was tested was on a cruise ship of older people. There the death rate was lt 1 If you extrapolate those results to the US population the death rate could be between 05 less than the regular flu and 5 So knowing the virulence of this flu currently would indicate that the best decision is to not close everything and collapse the economy for something that is potentially less dangerous than the flu. Look at Washington the first state to get it less than 300 people have died there. See Sweden they will be the test case for very limited protective measures...
Most people your age voted for this guy and still support him.
Hey guys don t worry my mom went to the ER and didn t see many people. Coronavirus is a hoax. Everyone can go back outside
Even if that's the case why would the federal govt be shipping emergency supplies into the US handing it off to private industry so they can turn a handsome profit and start bidding wars with the states they're supposed to represent. This would be like having your dad go to cvs and pick up your mom's medication bring it back and hand it to the local drug dealer who tacks on his cut and starts a bidding war with your mom and all the neighbors.
So what should the uninsured do today edit forgot word
Is it in our best interest to push a drug that is showing neutral results at best thereby causing a premature shortage to the people with chronic illnesses that the drug is proven to treat Because my aunt who voted for him can't get her prescription right now to treat her rheumatoid arthritis. The president is not a doctor or a scientist neither are the vast majority of politicians running their mouths in general. Good news is that the office of president has access to the best medical advisors in the country so he should listen to them on how to word things on this topic.
Agreed. There s the time to test for adverse affects and the time to produce and distribute billions of units
The even bigger question if the stockpiles were empty why did Trump send 18 tons of medical supplies and equipment to China politifact.com in February
Just wait. Making her listen will be listed under the cruel and unusual on the divorce decree.
were not all together according to our president. Only those who are nice
Dr. Fauci is a real doctor. He doesn t talk medicine with you if you don t have a science background. His job is to educate and advise. 95 of americans have no business investigating if hydroxychloroquine is an effective drug or not people have already died because they took matters into their own hands.
COVID 19 has made Klan meetings so much harder
but you're okay with the President lying every night
Um did you see their faces at the end Holy shit
I didn't even wanna go anyway
Thank you for proving you re an idiot. The point of a quarantine and stay at home order is to prevent spread and unnecessary death. Sorry a pandemic interrupted your normally scheduled program

Burn Trump to the ground this time
I'm not lying and there is no point for me to. I know how much I weight consistently because I've been trying to put more mass on for past few years. It's hard for me to put on weight so when I get sick I weigh myself just to see how much I dropped. You say it's mathematically impossible but all you've quoted so far is basic calorie facts that you learn in high school. You don't take into equation of a person's muscle fat water ratio as well they're resting rate of burning calories. Water weight is what goes when someone drops weight fast. It's how MMA fighters drop 20 to 30 pounds a week before weigh ins and look like a meth addict on the scales but the next day look completely full and normal. When you're sick you drink a lot of fluids and usually eat a little bit of carbs daily. The high intake of fluids and low intake of carbs causes your body to begin to expel the water your body normally carries. It's what MMA fighters and Boxers do to cut weight and what pro bodybuilders do before shows. 13 pounds of pure fat in 3 days is next to impossible for a regular person but 13 pounds of overall weight is not hard for someone that carries a lot of muscle and is 230 lbs based on the other poster More muscle more water weight because muscles are predominately water so more water to lose.
Good time to protest
You don t really understand government do you We voted in the creation of the CDC. You want this changed then go campaign for it. That s the nature of a democracy. You need to participate and take self Responsibility to keep it in check. That said go ahead and go go outside. Hopefully Darwin will take care of ya.
I'm trying Jennifer But seriously I'm willing to be a front runner and go somewhere else if this whole November thing doesn't work out. You taking applicants
A few things I wanna say about this. I find the term illegal alien confusing can we call them what they are Undocumented immigrant How would we even get funds to people not in the system It should be illegal to hire undocumented immigrants that do not have green cards period. The people hiring these people are part of the problem. IRS should crack down more on this imo anybody not recording what they make should be jailed.
The south park episode on this topic is one of the better ones that came out recently. I would recommend it.
I don t know what you re on about. In case you didn t hear he learned his lesson dontyaknow.

If you read the article you'll see he already is doing a better job. Plus considering the fact Trump put him in charge of ramping up testing after it was completely botched and now we're up to 150 000 being done a day. He's proving he can get shit done.
Thanks for proving my point
I think they say more along the lines of if people wish to stay home and stay safe that's awesome. Those who are not worried are not afraid of infection can go to said places. Meaning the individual takes their own responsibility knowing the risk. Least that's what I figure.
Fuck this traitorous piece of shit.
On the plus side maybe I'll invest in Google this time around. On the down side we'd have to live through 8 years of Bush again.
Who needs enemies when you have allies like the UE
Oh they will.
gt So back to Cuomo...count the fact that he has a fever is hopefully resting dehydrated from sweating during sleep without any additional hydration or eating and legit it s very possible. And that he's 230 lbs and ripped. More muscle mass you have the easier it is to cut water weight. I think the majority of people here have just never cut weight in their lives. Or lifted weights for that matter.
I don't like this picture of her it doesn't look NSFW enough. Should be one of those standard pics of AOC with her mouth wide open prepared for some deep throat.

Shut the fuck up Reason. There's nothing serious about your entitled libertarian philosophy. Get back to your online high school homework you've got a civics test on Monday and you're clearly not ready for it.
Governments can clearly have the authority to restrict anything but I don't think it should have it and that doing so is morally bad. It's an extremely principled approach and I would be genuinely interested to see if you find any such restrictions that I would have to support except for in cases when it would directly violate someone elses basic human rights.
Trump has a magic wand. Ask Obama about it.

AOC is an Agent Of Chaos
Don't know why you are getting downvoted for telling the truth I work in this industry and the simple truth is the foreign labor is just better. If you go to the top Universities and look at their programs you will see foreigners at the top. Americans needs to get students excited for STEM again so they produce better graduates
Well fuck. Just another step towards autocracy.
gt This is why libertarians are a laughing stock. Only by people who don't value individual liberties but who cares about morons gt You care about means more than ends Almost every damn time. Freedom is a very important end unto itself and damn the consequences. Freedom is messy and it's not for the cowardly or faint of heart. If you want a parent go sell yourself into slavery and stop insisting that everybody else accept your version of safety.

I'm guessing this stupid Durham report is going to drop just in time to smear Biden with lies like they did Hillary.
Didn't the US government sell their stockpiled masks to China in January Thought I read that somewhere. If so the country could have been more adequately prepared at this point.
Can we please just remove him from office already He s clearly incompetent and dangerous to not just Americans but people around the world who desperately need supplies. I am tired of seeing this orange dorito and his cult doing whatever they please at the cost of lives.

Certain numbers haven't slowed down new york for example which makes up a good chunk of confirmed infections and deaths. The whole country is not in that situation.
He s definitely losing his damage deposit.
You're not really arguing apples to apples. The better argument against would be that economic downturns result in deaths directly due to unemployment lapse in healthcare benefits etc. The conversation SHOULD be what will yield less deaths If the economy tanks people will die as a result so is it actively saving lives or not.
States critical for Trump to win re election. Which he s also fucking up. He s leaving Michigan for dead. The state he won the presidency on by 40 000 voters.

gt The website for the stockpile was edited on Friday after media outlets pointed out that its home page contradicted Kushner's claim. In case you missed it this is just a poor reboot of 1984 planetebook.com
Good lord you're ignorant to history. Franklin had 6 household slaves at his worst. You really think having 6 household slaves got him his power influence and wealth The closest he came to growing his wealth off slavery was running ads in his newspaper for it but he also ran ads for abolition groups so I think that was just more a case of him running ads for whoever paid him. You're acting as if he ran a massive plantation or slave trade and made his money off of torturing slaves in order to prove your point. In reality he had a small number of well treated household slaves he released upon his death. He was also an abolitionist by the time he died. I'm sure you would've been super moral at the time and gone against the grain lmfao. I'm sure you and I hold beliefs today that will be looked at as barbaric in 200 years does that mean every belief we hold is invalid
When you have MOFOs like Byron Pitts saying outlandish stuff like this but won't blame China for any of its roll regarding the WuhanChinaCoronaVirus my conspiracy spidey senses light up like a Christmas tree.
I refuse to watch that movie I'm still pissed. Props to Jimmy Carter for pointing out that's now how it happened.
But they are against communism. The irony is deafening.
The country is doing fine though I mean rn we got a pandemic but it was doing fine before lmao
This needs to be answered. This should be the question on everyone's mind. Why send aid to China if they were already fumbling the response covering up Why risk losing that gear if we didn't have a stockpile Why send all those supplies and then ignore the virus and not immediately replenish The correct response might have looked like the U.S telling China if you stop travel for a month we will send you all the aid in helping battle this. It's an extreme failure on behalf of the administration the intelligence community and CCP. It's too late the cats out of the bag and the cats pregnant.

lol your primary source is CNN no thanks dude I love how both sides of the political spectrum have chosen to live in a post fact world. I don't like your source so it doesn't count' is something I expect from trump supporters but I guess I'm not surprised to see r politics willing to play the same game when it suits them. the guy being interviewed is the director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management. I guess your argument here is emergency management directors are partisan appointees
Some hospitals have a lot of cases. Most counties have less than 200 cases some with 1 or 0. Hospitals being over run is media hype to get you to buy into their fear mongering. My mom went to the ER Wednesday night and said they place was mostly a ghost town.
Your country wasn't the first affected. It isn't by far the poorest. It isn't the biggest. And yet is has the highest numbers. Why Maybe because ur government didn't take it serious in the beginning Maybe because Trump said it would be gone in April like a miracle just to stop the downrating of the stock market Maybe because your government didn't use the WHO tests in the beginning Maybe because Trump dismissed the team to fight a pandemic two years ago and lost something about a month to respond the threat And when he is asked about these facts he calls it nasty or blames Obama for the heritage of bad tests when in reality there couldn't have been tests at these times. Also he tweeted in 2014 that Obama should retreat because of 2 Ebola deaths and 14 infected but now he would see it as a good job if there would only die 100000.
He even got the free personal pan pizza for it too
the problem is that we view insurance as a necessity. you shouldn't need insurance to get basic healthcare. prices should be transparent up front and competitive. if they were insurance prices would drop and be more affordable. that said i told everyone Trump was a lib. the good kind though not the marxist kind. also 2nd Trump term confirmed.
It's a great indicator that someone needs a refresher on basic civics if they take this seriously. And there's plenty of Poindexters that do just that in about every Bee article that's posted. Have a great weekend.
Yeah. This submission is just more off topic dreck from the degenerate propagandist Glenn Beck.
Someone needs to make a list of everyone disappeared in China related to this Chinese Virus. Then people need to start searching for them and investigating this. Then we need to pay extra close attention to the investigators. The truth needs to come out not just the fact they disappeared.
On the basis of current condition we can say Trump fail to solve this problem or it's controlled in future. Bcz vaccine take very large time. God pray

No these people are very dangerous. They're going to push for an all new 100 virtual election in November or some shit. Then they're going to steal it. Yuge majorities in both houses of Congress plus the Presidency. Ballot harvesting in CA was a dry run for this on a national level. Look how that turned out. Conservatives need to put their foot down hard and DEMAND a normal election in November. No special rules. No fraud. Also kiss the Barr Durham investigations goodbye. Democrats have run out the clock on them with the lockdowns due to the virus. So very convenient for them
this is not civil discussion.
When Trump accuses someone of something it's called projection. He's doing it so everyone else is also.
I already got put in the hospital from the damn virus I'm just lucky I didn't die.

Our governor PA Dem is highly encouraging residents to mail in ballots in the name of avoiding crowds and such. I m hoping polling places are open though...does anyone know if this crisis means the government doesn t have to open polling places Our primary was postponed to June and I m not questioning that.

Yes we're all taking that risk. But again eventually you'll realize you have to leave your house eventually and in fact you will get sick again.
Yes but there's a slight issue. 1. Company is US based so they'd have to move HQs which isn't exactly easy to do over an international border overnight. 2. The US makes up about 13 billion of their 32 billion in total sales so pulling out from the US would be equivalent roughly not exactly to giving up 1 3 of your potential buissness which would be a huge hit to 3M. 3M pulling up roots in the US just wouldn't be a good idea and it isn't even something they could do quicly.
yes

Like in Russia all of the power rests with one guy. He allows oligarchs to be rich but they have no real authority.
Yeah but that ain't gonna happen states would have the biggest fit of all fits if the federal government took over elections. The federal government currently has no involvement in elections not insofar as registering people to vote collecting votes or counting votes anyways.
For what it's worth Canada has announced a 2000 CAD or 1400 USD per month short term aid package for people unable to work due to Covid 19. It's not universal you had to have been working before. But it's gonna help a lot of people.

I saw a story on this subreddit a few weeks ago about how lab technicians at the Level 4 bio lab three miles from the wet market in Wuhan were selling animals used in their experiments at the market to make extra money.

More research is needed. So why are you morons over here tooting your own horn It could end up not being beneficial at all. It could be placebo. No wonder not many conservatives are medical professionals y all would be giving essential oils to cancer patients.
Too much weight is given to the words of journalists and celebrities. Shit gets old after awhile.
No one said you can't go outside you just can't go inside with a bunch of people if its not necessary and whether inside or out in public you should stay at a distance.

I m sure you are a believer in some form of collectivism so we know you ve never worked for anything.
Doubt it but maybe I over estimate our citizenry
The US is doing a Payroll Protection Program kinda similar. A loan for 2. 5 months of payroll that can be forgivable if your employees wages don't decrease Actually Full Time Equivalents Applications opened today we will see if we can actually get the loan. And if we get it hopefully it is actually forgivable. The US doesn't have the best track record See Federal Student Loan Forgiveness
You know I have mostly held conservative views for most things but I am in awe of how many people actually live paycheck to paycheck. I just thought I was doing something wrong. An extra 2000 dollars a month would absolutely change my life for the better. I wouldn t be so stressed all the time and would be able to enjoy my days off.
The west coast could do it. Only three states fairly purple and that s where we get stuff from China.
So back when they said everyone was being a alarmist and this virus was going to be so bad when experts from the around the world said different. Was that the truth
The firing in 30 days is irrelevant as Trump placed Atkinson on administrative leave as of tonight. For all intents and purposes he was fired tonight.
No. But Trump can't suspend the election
You could be a carrier whose actions lead to the death of others. It's pretty simple. Until we have antibody tests out in large enough numbers we can't say for sure who has had this.
This is the conservative dream baby
Just require an SSN.
Great. You are not at risk at a lower one Congrats. They can just stay at home for however long the pandemic lasts right Except that if everyone that feels invincible is out there it won't go down for a very long time. In a country with social safety networks or maybe with an UBI they might be able to not go to work and still survive. They'll have to go out once they get evicted for not being able to pay rent. They'll starve. As it is you're telling them to choose their poison. They need to work. But let's say they don't Are you suggesting they do photosynthesis They will have to buy groceries. If they are asmathic diabetic or whatever that causes them to be at risk they'll have to buy medicines if they can afford them in the first place even assuming they have a job And so on. Everyone else is propagating the virus like crazy. The cashiers will likely have it it will be on the groceries the tons of idiots hoarding toilet paper can also spread it etcetera. Even if the particularly vulnerable quit their jobs and shop every 15 days with an otherwise uncontrolled spread they will still be exposed a lot. Your actions would still kill plenty of these people. Btw obviously the virus kills more people that have risk factors than those who don't It's no ebola but it's not a flu either. In South Korea the country that handled this the best way possible tested a lot traced cases and avoided the collapse of the healthcare system so they have almost the lowest mortality rate possible the death rate for those aged 30 39 is way higher than that of the flu in the US in every age group except for 65 years. At the very least twice and that's on the 50 64 range Now apply that to an oversaturated healthcare system and you get Spain or Italy where thousands of people have died even though they implemented lockdowns weeks ago. There have been cases in Spain of a few police officers that died with no known previous illness including one that was 37 years old. But let's assume that you're as inmune as you think to the virus though if you're a man and you smoke that's already technically 2 risk factors. Let's hope at least you're fit What do you think is going to happen if you have a car accident while the ICUs are collapsed and the doctors and nurses completely overworked plenty of them even ill with COVID 19 Just don't drive a car right Merkel said that if they didn't take any measures 70 of the German population would get infected. With a 3. 4 mortality rate that's 2. 38 of the population. Is that a necessary sacrifice for you In the US that would be almost 8 million deaths just from the virus let alone those that are indirectly caused by it. Besides around 20 of cases require hospitalization. Do you think everything will be fine with that many people unable to work and scrambling to put them somewhere because you won't have enough beds That's just psycopathic and incredibly selfish. I'm 19 years old I don't smoke I'm not asmathic or diabetic and have no conditions and I'm staying the fuck home. Because I do care if my actions end up killing tens of people directly. I bet if this virus thrived against people of your characteristics you would be begging people to respect the quarantine. Just like everyone that were part of the Democratic Hoax train until someone close to them died.
not a chance.
Actually the guy that Capt. Crozier replaced is coming back. He was also a well respected CO so they ll be in good hands.

Because Furthermore severe staffing shortages are anticipated and purchasing additional ventilators beyond a threshold will not save additional lives because there will not be a sufficient number of trained staff to operate them the report also reads. Could New York have purchased 15 000 ventilators Sure they could have but the report found that it wouldn t have actually helped. So the intent was false.
Not at this rate.
Its probably closer to 380 person paid in considering the assumed 14M illegal immigrants in the US is a wildly low estimate. Personally I am in the camp that estimates around 30M based on historical trends. I know many claim 11M to 12M and somehow claim the total number is decreasing year over year do they think we are that stupid But ICE detained 850M people attempting to cross the US Mexico border illegally last year cbp.gov What percent do you think they catch I think half is generous. That means 850M new illegal immigrants entered. Also odd how the wikipedia article graphs stop in 2016. lol they really do think we are that stupid.

gt Not sure where you're going Not going anywhere. Just wanted to confirm that Leftists believe we have the right to end another human life as we please. You seem to agree with that idea so we're on the same page. I mean... reality might be different but the idea that leftists live in reality was thrown out the window a long time ago lol And on a side note... gt Most developed nations Why do people keep pretending this is a good bar for right and wrong It's a great argument for the mentally weak... There was a point where most developed nations still held some form of slavery not so sure that made slavery any less awful.
Rural Americans do

Just because you arbitrarily choose sentience as when a human life matters doesn't mean that's fact. The fact is that once it starts growing it's a unique human with unique DNA and will become a full grown human unless it self aborts or is killed by someone. I don't think it's fair to say it's a rights issue when it comes to murdering someone which is what you have to understand about this perspective. It's comparable to saying people should have the right to kill torture dogs and cats because they're not human and don't have human feelings and that being opposed to it is trampling on the rights of people who want to kill them. It makes that little sense.
No car accidents do not increase exponentially. I m not suggesting we don t follow what has been prescribed. The stats are starting to show it is helping. My argument is against those saying one life is worth the US economy. It is not. The flu kills between 12 000 61 000 people in the US per year since 2010 according to the CDC. That s with a vaccine for a few of the most common strains of the influenza virus. There have been 58 243 deaths from Coronavirus worldwide. I get that it will get worse. I understand exponential growth....I m simply saying we should put things into perspective and consider options. That s all. No one knows how bad this can be. Projections vary on a day by day basis. There are so many variable to take into account as well.
gt Yeah most Americans aren t that smart I m sorry. And that's too bad. Think of it this way......Fast Food places are unhealthy especially if you frequent them a lot. And we both know that there are many obese people that are always there. And I don't even mean people who surpass some BMI index. I mean huge people. Why are they there Because they are stupid and don't even realize that they are practicing a slow form of suicide. Well how about we CLOSE all fast food places until the FAT people stop going to them. That is inflicting nonsense on the majority because of those too fucking stupid to live their own lives responsibly. And remember that those obese people are burdening the healthcare system since they have a myriad of obesity related health issues. So if you are medically comprised and you go out to a restaurant and get the virus which nudges you over the cliff and speeds up you imminent demise....too bad. It was your choice. No one forced you to endanger yourself.
You know I was about to call it a night and go to sleep now your comment got me all angry and want to yell at a ghost.

gt 3M was orded by law to produce items for the United States. Do you have a source for this 3M manufactures all around the world and get this they give the product to their distributors. 3M doesn't sell direct to anyone. The distributors make the deals and there was no such deal forcing them to turn over a part or all of their production to the US.
I don t have answers to your questions but I followed some of this guys post history from another thread and it seems like GrandpaHardcore is not all there anymore. I d just move on as I m doing now.
God save the queen.
Still 2 3 million deaths is 5 7x the deaths we had in WW2. Not good.
We d only end up with no masks if were reliant on something from Canada that Canada stops sending us. That s literally what I meant with the cut off the nose to spite the face comment. And you clearly don t understand the metaphor. Planes have enough masks but small children and the disabled aren t able to put theirs on without help. The soft hearted might be tempted to help the child before putting on their own but in doing so they might pass out and be unable to put on their own which would make it so that they are unable to help anyone else. Simplified we can t help anyone if we re dead or incapacitated.
gt Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

gt I think it s obvious the upper echelon of the Navy in particular has not factored in the effects of a pandemic on military preparedness. That's the problem with the US in general. It has only ever prepared for one type of conflict outright open physical conflict. Meaning traditional war. It has no defense against intelligence war. It has no defense against guerrilla war. The list goes on. The US pours billions and billions into national defense but that national defense is primed to protect against old fashioned outright war. That doesn't exist anymore because MAD ensures it doesn't The US has been building up and up to take on a war that was never going to come the second nuclear missiles entered the equation on both sides. It simply isn't prepared for a pandemic it isn't prepared for intelligence warfare it isn't prepared for anything else and the seams are finally showing.
Hey this is supposed to be published on the bottom right corner of page 11 of the local gazette. You cant be blastin this story all up on reddit like this. What gives
Yeah I had to stop watching after I saw that.
Yeah it's being poor and black not being a person who has a greater chance of being a person who is morbidly obese and a smoker. Unless you are saying that poor people make bad choices no matter their skin color as this also holds true to poor whites.
the point is that it was naked corruption and it s completely unrelated
You're a liar when you say Conservative are anti military. I see anti military hate every day on reddit it's always from your leftist buddies never Conservatives. If you're lying about that then it's likely that you're lying about everything.

Only if you can show in a specific case that a specific person was directly responsible for someone else getting sick and you can prove they knew they were doing it can you justify punishing them for it. Doing it in advance on people you have no evidence are sick is completely unjustified.

Please take us.

The election is going to be about the flu and the poor response to it. BlueWave2020
Look guys I understand that Biden is more of the old and that nothing moves forward with him. I understand that he may be having some mental issues. I understand all of that and I hear you all 100 of all of these concerns and honestly I'm with you. I'm a die hard Bernie supporter man but let's face it. BIDEN IS NOT AND WILL NEVER DO THIS SHIT THAT TRUMP IS DOING At least with Biden we can restore democracy and the Republic. With Biden we can prosecute Trump and all his cronies. With Biden this shit NEVER HAPPENS. NEVER. Bernie supporters who I see constantly spamming Reddit saying that they're fed up with the DNC. I HEAR YOU. Bernie supporters who are pissed at MSM not covering Bernie. I HEAR YOU. However Bernie supporters who say they will not vote for Biden. I can't be with you on that. Biden is kumquat. No doubt about it. But ya know what Biden isnt and will never be THIS So I beg of you. Come November if Bernie can't pull off this victory which I would love to see you need to get out there and Vote Blue No Matter Who This is the last stand. American Democracy is hanging on by a thread. We can still save this country and restore it but it has to be done on November 2nd. This is America's last hope to hold onto our Democracy. So whether its Bernie please please please please or Biden we all need to band together and remove this tumor from office because if we fail to do so Trump will have free reign to take over this country. Don't let 2018 be for nothing. Vote Blue no matter who. It's our last chance to save this country.
It sounds like it but it just looks like a little piece of tape. I have also heard it feels like Velcro.

Do you know what his paygrade was Unless he was stupid with his money he's fine. Even if he was stupid with his money he can make a killing on the lecture and public appearance circuit you know once we can all gather in public again with the instant fame his firing created.

That said part of the job is to maintain operational readiness which includes doing his best for a crew who are quickly passing a highly virulent and potentially deadly virus around the ship. FWIW I've heard unsubstantiated rumors that he did attempt to go through channels but was brushed off before he went the squeaky wheel route. Note the word unsubstantiated

Nope. You only sweat after the fever breaks. Or in the rare case were your body over heats beyond what it intended mycarpe.com mycarpe.com gt Once a person s body initiates the fever process chemical messengers called pyrogens are released into the bloodstream. Pyrogens are part of the immune system response and through a complex chemical process cause a person s body to raise in temperature. Once a person has a fever they will often exhibit symptoms like headache malaise anorexia and other sickness behaviours. A person with a fever will also experience heat generating mechanisms like skin vasoconstriction which leads to chills and goosebumps muscle contractions shivering and a desire to be warm. Once a person s temperature reaches its new high setpoint and a fever runs its course the body lowers its setpoint and begins to employ body cooling processes. Due to the fact that sweating is the body s primary way to cool itself down people who are recovering from a fever often experience sweating as a part of that process. It is the body s natural way of cooling itself down and regaining its normal homeostasis. 2 Heres the mayo clinc link you should have done btw which i know why you didnt link for Fevers. mayoclinic.org mayoclinic.org Depending on what's causing your fever additional fever signs and symptoms may include Its not a symptom of every fever only under certain circumstances do you sweat and primarily once you cool down as well. Stop trying to make excuses for this obvious lie. amp x200B Even you weak as Fevers listed as dehydration goes out of its way to suggest when its paired with other symptoms Fever. In general the higher your fever the more dehydrated you may become. The problem worsens if you have a fever in addition to diarrhea and vomiting. amp x200B furthermore the Water weight lost is regained once you drink. And a prolonged water loss of that level would actually inhibit his mental capabilities and create excessive thirst. The first thing he would do is drink water Which i can tell you he most likely did as well during amp x200B How fucking desperate are you morons getting now Look we get it Gotta suck that CNN cock any chance you get But we already know the truth. amp x200B gt Thanks for the suggestion on reading and learning. Fell on deaf ears as you couldn't read the word May in your own link and couldn't read the part about when its paired with vomit and diarrhea. Also couldn't understand that the weight would be recovered second he drank and that he had done so already when he made the statement.

trump has downplayed the virus repeatedly
Erm what shipment
My point is that it's a greater than less than argument. There is no price to put on a human life. Trying to equate lives to dollars is fundamentally disgusting and I hope you're not trying to go down that road. The argument that needs to be made is what will yield less deaths Period. That's it. Will shutting down the economy yield less deaths from every source or will it yield more deaths from every source A shrinking economy will cause starvation and homelessness which yields deaths. Lack of healthcare yields deaths. The number of deaths Coronavirus causes needs to be greater than that to shut down the economy. So far it appears that it will not be the case and shutting the economy down will be worse outside of major cities. It really ought to be looked at on a case by case basis and not necessarily from a general perspective.

FTA Brewing criticism of the central government s handling of the crisis and the subsequent economic shocks have the real potential to be a threat multiplier to the Communist Party s legitimacy. This desperation for a deflected and nationalist narrative is where the aggressive disinformation campaign ties in. It is also likely connected to China s global ambitions especially the regime s fear that it will be blamed internationally for the pandemic in light of its botched initial response. Despite the rosy view being painted for the outside Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his credibility is on the line and the careful but genuine jockeying within China s politburo has already begun. The coming months will likely see no letup in US China tensions and other regional security concerns such as Taiwan and the South China Sea as Beijing attempts to distract from its own culpability and mismanagement of the COVID 19 crisis.

So 1 If there is any position in the Executive Branch that should not be able to be fired without cause it's the IGs. I disagree with firing someone like Comey but there is something to be said for the President needing to be able to trust and work with his advisers. The fact that Trump values loyalty over competence doesn't really change this when considering future administrations. However given that the job of the IG is oversight the President having the ability without recourse to terminate their employment without cause other than losing confidence undermines the whole point of oversight. I know that at the end of the day it probably wouldn't go anywhere but I hope Atkinson tries to sue him for wrongful termination. There's always the possibility that he could get a judge that would at least allow discovery which could be interesting in it's own right. 2 My bigger question on this is whether this is simply petty revenge this is Trump or if he is trying to get rid of Atkinson as the election gets closer for some specific reason
Those are some crazy requirements. I bet there's only a dozen people in the entire country that would have that combination of things on their resume.

Most covid cases because we are testing the most people. Liberals cried screamed jumped up and down said that the government's not doing enough we aren't testing enough people we need to be doing more so we ramped up testing once the infrastructure got in place and now we're testing more than anyone else and our numbers go up... well obviously they're going to. We have a much higher population than other countries in Europe that are running near the same number of tests we are so of course we're going to have higher overall numbers but if you look at the mortality rate in our country versus the other countries we have some of the lowest numbers in the world. And that doesn't take into account the people who are positive that haven't yet been tested if your numbers are doubling overnight which they were a couple weeks ago then you expect four time that number to be positive that aren't tested. That's putting the overall mortality rate at about 0. 5 to 0. 6 in the U.S with that being in the case you can look at a country like Italy with a mortality rate of 10 That's 20 times the actual mortality rate of this virus that means they're 100 000 cases is about 20 times lower than what it should be because they aren't running the test that they should be. so you can jump up and down and scream that we have the most cases in the world but it simply isn't the case.

Some places are arresting people breaking quarantine for attempted murder. In the old days people would be executed for breaking quarantine. Ability to enforce quarantine is a prerequisite to ability to have a quarantine. The whole point of quarantine is that it is a life or death situation or at least has the potential for massive damage. Sure this is no smallpox but it has enough death rate for even China to shut down cities and the death rate will get really tragic if the need for ICU exceeds our medical capacity.

I think I'd go after their broadcast license as they are given a broadcasting license permission to broadcast at a certain electromagnetic wavelength which should have something of a clause in there about not broadcasting something that would knowingly endanger the general population. Something akin to knowing where riots are happening in a city and knowingly diverting traffic directly into the worst areas for people trying to flee. Something something public safety. Or maybe have the FDA do some serious flexing and make every single time Trump or announcer tout the virtues of the new snakeoil coronavirus cure a strong overlay which reads Not verified by the Surgeon General.... You know what the whole fucking empire needs to go. Fox has caused demonstrable loss of life through their direct speeches and programs. If medical science has been Lebowski'd that's just like your opinion man and it can be proven that Fox knowingly encouraged listeners to regard an exact falsehood as fact leading to the death of citizens how could that not be regarded as a true Enemy of the State It's directly killing citizens through known misinformation dissemination And for a final thought if that enemy of the state is not even forced to endure even a symbolic gesture of remonstation what does that tell citizens about the true nature of the State Tl Dr We in a fascistic dictator state y'all The only truth here is that the current batch of politicians ain't so good about keeping it a secret. And one could argue the urgent and imminent need to have a judge to an emergency hearing on the matter. Additionally for anyone that might suggest avoiding pulling Fox from the airwaves

Well I think virtually everyone in politics is guilty of that. But I think it's inherent to politics. It isn't the politics but the emotions they invoke. People get very passionate about certain political issues especially people that want to get into politics. And I'd say that is the right reason to get into politics as opposed to getting something out of it personally However it can be biologically impossible to be completely rational about something when it sparks strong emotions as any information that is in conflict with that emotion is either inaccessible or distorted. I don't know if she's dogmatic enough to be a zealot but then I suppose the definition has become more broad over time. That said I think it's less dangerous for someone like her to be in office as opposed to someone there for their own gain at the cost of others. She might have some percent chance of doing harm but the latter is a certainty.

Cool story but if you're sick and go out in public you should still be run over by a tank
Remember when AOC told people to not be racist and to go eat at Chinese restaurants That aged like sour milk Remember when every news outlet stated this was no worse than the flu The truth is no one really knows what to do around this and the knowledge of the virus is pretty minimal. Some news sources say the fatalities would ve been reduced by 95 had China not covered this up from the beginning. We can follow models and predictions and science and any other so called expect but no one knows the effects this is going to have on society
It has nothing to do with you being sick or not. You can be a vehicle for the virus whether you are showing symptoms or not OR right after being exposed while going out. Just as your freedom of speech does not apply to shouting fire in packed building. Your freedom of assembly does not apply to roaming around during a quarantine. You can and will be held criminally responsible for being reckless.

Those elderly has been contaminated because of sick medical personnel sent to work with our without symptoms not having masks or not having the right to use them before a declared outbreak not to waste them which is beyond dump in a locked down environment People need to understand that ventilators are only prolongating the almost inevitable. No matter in which condition you are once you are showing severe symptoms it s over.
He's doing to MI what the GOP did to southern states under Obamacare. The states refused billions in federal funds that would have helped people afford health insurance then blamed Obamacare. Now Trump is jerking MI around and he's going to blame Whitmer try to turn MI against the dems. At the cost of thousands of lives but no one batted an eye when governors let people die just to fuel outrage against Obama. They'll keep using the same tricks until those tricks stop working.
No I ask because you seem to be an expert on how viruses are transmitted.

Nice I wish that we could all have civilize discourse again. I have a lot of liberal friends who I respect and have pretty good discussions. We don t agree on politics but we don t bring politics into everything either. You seem like a guy I d be glad to have a beer with.
I'd take Romney over whatever Pile of shit is gonna replace him
The guy I was replying to apparently knows many people with that mindset right now. Probably watches too much main stream media doom and gloom
Bunch of goddamned idiots
Dude you need to get out of your own ass. Essential to you means performing at 50 of your potential vs others literally dying because hospitals are overwhelmed. Have some perspective you will make it through this. I'm glad to hear you still have a job.
Should probably check them all for wifi signals. Imagine what kind of data they could gain access to from within hospitals and medical institutions while they are distracted with a pandemic and not actively checking their digital security

Your logic only applies to those who wanted Kavenaugh to be removed on allegations only thus they should also want Biden to drop out based on allegations. The rest of us are saying innocent until proven guilty and yes same is true for Biden.

So with an estimated 14 million illegal immigrants in the USA this amounts to approx. 757 dollars paid in taxes per person which is under the amount simply covered paying sales tax on groceries. This report desperately tries to make this look good but fails hard. It also does not report the massive tax burden of illegals which amounts to a low end of 54 billion per year per apnews.com or 135 billion per year at the high end per fairus.org In either case the fiscal burden is far higher than their supposed tax contribution.
I think you can say they have not tested positive because lots of people are asymptomatic.
But how do we know he is exaggerating. I really feel this is misplaced and unfair. Who are we to judge how he feels. This just seems dark.

Says numerous doctors. Yall need to lay off the leftist propaganda
This argument could be applied to Everything. The Seasonal Flu access to Guns and a variety of other deadly but not as deadly diseases. The Arguments used to shut down the country for COVID 19 could be used to justify shutting down the country and limiting rights for a vast number of things. This is the slippery slope and we're on it. Freedom has always been a tradeoff we're conservatives we should be fighting to preserve our freedoms ESPECIALLY in the face of a crisis not bending over and trusting government to hand our freedoms back when the crisis is over. The Price of Freedom is eternal vigilance and i'm seeing a huge lack of it. Any who would trade some freedom for some security deserve neither and will lose both.
Obviously. Not sure how that's relevant to my comment about liberals thinking the whole world revolves around those cities.
Good point.
I think they should probably bring charges of negligent manslaughter for the anchors. There is probably a better charge but nothing will happen... This effectively hands waiving... The US isn't really geared anymore towards holding the guilty and wealthy accountable. Maybe it never was... dunno.

Main issue I have with it is that this stuff is one of the main treatments for autoimmune disease and it also has increasing risks with lifetime cumulative exposure. So what happens when we've got a whole swath of folks who accumulated hydroxychloroquine exposure for no good reason given there's not much evidence it actually helps with covid 19 and later on need to take the drug for an autoimmune condition Now they're at increased risk of a whole slew of nasty side effects. Not to mention we have no idea yet if covid 19 triggers autoimmunity in susceptible populations which viruses often do. I dunno man. I just think it's super dumb to be mass prescribing a drug like this when there's so little evidence that it helps and when the tradeoff is accumulation of eyeball poison.
All hail the holy constitution documents that never took into account the possibility of a pandemic.

It doesnt matter. 4 more years of trump will kill any hope of a progressive policy change within the next few years due to further court stacking. He needs to go no matter what. A vote for anyone but the nominee is a vote for trump. Bernie will support biden if he drops so should all of his supporters. While I do hope bernie wins its not looking likely.
Nope just democrats. I haven't downvoted you once
It depends on what the conclusions proposed are. If someone were arguing that i.e Denmark was doing such a better job as proven by the fact that they have less total deaths from the virus that would be misleading. I also dont think its good to say well we have more people in total so having more people die in total is ok and expected.

HIV doesn't spread easily and everyone can choose for himself if he wants to take the risk. It's not comparable to a viral pandemic so highly infectious like the Spanish flu or CoVid19. The people around you can't choose to risk or not risk getting the Virus. Their life is at risk just by being in the same supermarket like an infected person. That's a major difference regarding the freedom argument.

Canada should look at protecting its citizens internally which we have done by signing deals with three Canadian based manufacturers. Redirecting unneeded materials or personnel to put pressure on America by harming their citizens is not an acceptable solution IMHO. New York has a little over half the population and 8x the amount of people that have contracted covid. I'm not prepared to put their citizens lives in danger just to save our own.
Except the people he surrounded himself with for his first term were monsters who committed war crimes. I don't care how smart they were. And plenty of them were also fools or sycophants or both.

No that s incorrect an N95 quality mask does block the virus when worn correctly. I also keep seeing what you re saying repeated over and over most people don t know how to wear them So.. the focus should be on education and fitting them correctly to your face. What I m saying is it shouldn t take government mandating people wearing masks because common sense should be enough for everyone to wear one. In this case people think it s just a suggestion and are spreading virus all over the place while people are dying from this.
do you have any better ideas Because 1. You are generalizing the people because of a few posters 2.

It's a dilemma. Good to have extras just in case of emergencies but needs to be balanced with cost and storage requirements.

I'm thoroughly impressed that it took us as little as it did to come up with tests and turn the manufacturing to meet the demands for masks hand sanitizer etc.

Right but what happens when you go to Safeway and get exposed to some dude who doesn t give a fuck about this coronavirus now you become a carrier and spread it home to your family at home Or the kid working at Safeway gets exposed by some self centered dbag who goes to the store knowing he s infected Is that ok This is something that literally hasn t happened before in modern times in our country. I mean if you re fine with that then I hope you stay home and are able to support yourself until this is over. But it does not sound like that s the case for you.
Voluntary self isolation and making good choices about protecting yourself and others is far different from forced isolation under the threat of violence. It's the difference between jail and hanging out at home.

I mean Republican controlled Congress refused to fund the restock citing fiscal responsibility but are silent when Trump blew our deficit up from 550 to 1. 2 Trillion while economy was strong At end of day Trump has been President for 3. 5 years. He fully owns this. What makes his ownership even worse is that our Intelligence agencies in January told him and the administration that this was a pandemic. We did no preparation. We watched other countries suffer and did not prepare to face it. I also distinctly remember somebody wantes 2B for stockpile after it was low early February but Trump Administration blocked it.
Dude. WTF HOLY SHIT

Also for the rest of them I have no faith he will make any meaningful changes. He really seems like the status quo candidate and I think the status quo is broken.
This post is truly BS. They are telling you to stay in side for Global safety. Everyone needs to social distance or many more people will die than need be. People saying oh they are trying to take away my rights. That is garbage this is a global crisis and must be taken seriously.

Trump BTFO to Schumer is historic gold. As you are aware the Federal Government is merely a back up for state governments Trump continued. Unfortunately your state needed far more of a back up than most others. Trump also accused Democrats of focusing on impeachment instead of the virus as it spread in China months ago. If you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere except increasing my poll numbers Trump wrote and instead focused on helping the people of New York then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the invisible enemy.' Trump's letters are going to be a favorite of Presidential scholars for decades.

There's a limitation on government powers for a reason. I'm sorry you just don't get it or you think that there can be extenuating circumstances that justify ignoring those limitations. I don't think there's ever a justification to take away rights of individuals no matter how many could potentially die. People should be informed so that they can make rational choices but I draw the line at using force to remove rights. Clearly you do not. The problem is that once you start justifying the stripping of rights from the people it's too easy to justify it for other stuff. This time you want to do it because a few thousand more may die. Next time you'll want to do it to reduce gun crime or reduce traffic accidents.
If we push for country wide vote by mail we sure will. We should have all the democratic governors request it. Then if the citizens demand it we will win for sure.
Oh no. The people that would rather see US citizens unemployed or in poverty because they want cheap shit might be upset. Somehow I m okay with that.

Heres the thing there is enough blame to go around. I don't like this he said she said bullshit. The fact is Trump did halt travel from China and was widely panned for the decision in the media. While he was taking that step Nancy and Chuck were busy distracting congress with a very solemn impeachment that literally everybody with more than 2 brain cells to rub together knew was dead in the water. Maybe if they weren't embarking on that partisan shit show a lot of things could have been done quicker.

Is this the NYT article cnn.com seems it was a re post by CNN so maybe we are talking the same reference In any case there's lots of ambiguous language and quotes in what is imo a skewed article. CA found 170 inoperable that's the governor's description the feds say the issues with some of the deployed ventilators were limited to their external batteries and one of the contracting companies said We're not hearing or seeing units showing up being truly or fundamentally broken...they probably have not been maintained. Which could simply mean they were past their PM due date. I know a lot about PMs but not ventilators specifically and my guess is that all this is about is equipment past their PM dates with maybe some needing batteries replaced. Machines don't just spontaneously break sitting unused in a warehouse.

just comparing case numbers and the time of shelter inplace orders doesn't gove you the full picture. case numbers depend a lot on testing. if one place tests less then their fatality rate will look artificially higher compared to a place that tests more per capita. also if two places shut down at the same time but with different numbers of cases at that point they can have a similar trajectory but the absolute numbers after e.g 10 days will still be different.

Exactly. If Canada cut electricity and fuel to US and prevented its healthcare workers crossing into Detroit the damage would not be insignificant. If Trump enforces this restriction on trade to us part of me hopes Trudeau locks up our border immediately no electricity fuel healthcare workers.

Plus we really need a space because r politics has been unfairly dominated be leftist views.
Facts Pelosi made her statement on 2 24. There were 48 confirmed cases in all of the US. Trump made similar statements on the same exact day. nbcbayarea.com nbcbayarea.com ashingtonpost.com ashingtonpost.com Trump was still downplaying the virus on national television and twitter on a regular basis as of 3 9. At that time there were 633 confirmed cases in the US. orldometers.info orldometers.info There are some differences with how when people changed their attitudes towards how to handle the crisis. The fact of the matter is that the comment in consideration here by Pelosi was made when the threat on American soil was significantly lower and at that time all politicians were pretty much echoing that sentiment. BONUS ROUND Trump bashed Obama administration for H1N1 deaths mounting to 17 000 dead this was incorrect as well actual number was closer to 13 000 propublica.org propublica.org Now Trump is ready to call 100 000 dead from COVID a very good job gq.com gq.com Do your research.

Lol Biden beat Bernie in Texas Florida Michigan North Carolina Virginia Michigan Minnesota and Arizona. All swing states. And I doubt that all Bernie voters are as dumb and short sighted as you are to see that a second term Trump presidency would be catastrophic for this country.
Brett crozier a captain ofhis crew l with many lives in his hands did the right thing for his crew. He is responsible for the well being of his men. His men s lives are on the line because they are showing symptoms and it can spread. He reports it to his superiors and now he is fired just like the nurses in USA putting their lives on the line to help patients denied their right to use masks and will get fired if they show up with a mask USA government you let your people down
Neither of those numbers are anywhere near true. Trump s highest approval rating was when he was elected.
I m sorry to have done that to you.
They meant it figuratively.

They are on freaking vacation right now. Most were on vacation when the shit hit the fan Pelosi had to fly back to shovel shit into the bill. Most Dems missed the Jan briefing on the virus. If I was in charge of stewarding my government there isn't anything you could do to me that would keep me out of DC. I'll wear a mask so as to not infect anyone else. I get it Ok.
We need a sticker to refute the dumb assertions they make. This on is about as balanced a response to the fired the pandemic team one. reuters.com I correct one after another on the same thing. I have a life work and a family. I don't have the time but it needs to be done.

gt It wouldn't fix poverty though don't even bother replying. it's the same argument that you will see here over and over again. Give 1000 a month to a homeless person and you destroy his life and make it a LOT worse. it reminds me of a republican argument Charities will take care of the poor.
I think that in this situation both are wrong. Trump downplayed the whole thing calling it a hoax and bragging that he's got it all under control and Biden just mindlessly attacking Trump. The ideal president would have seen the high infection rates in other countries and would realise this this is not a hoax and that he should start limiting people going in from countries. Not to mention Trump got rid of the pandemic team which I hope we can all agree was a crappy move. But this also goes down to the state level with Mississippi not taking it seriously and getting one of the highest death rates here
I strongly believe the terrible response is from the Trump administration is because this has largely hit Blue states first. When it really hits Red states harder he'll respond rapidly and won't drag his feet and fight with governors. He doesn't care what the perceptions are in CA NY and IL because he won't win those states.
Actually he did follow the chain of command. The email was written on an unsecured server that's why he got removed from office. He more than likely knew it would lead to his removal. His conscience wouldn't let him stand by and do nothing. He got what he wanted in the end.
People on the right are exposed to leftist ideology all day long. The main stream news Hollywood twitter facebook 99 of reddit they all constantly push leftist ideology. We need to limit the leftists here or they would completely take over the subreddit within a month. However putting yourself in a bubble is a huge concern for people on the left. They fight to censor and deplatform nonconforming opinions. They aren't exposed to conservative ideology unless they seek it out for themselves.
The skill level to worth at those places is pretty much the same. Except Starbucks typically pays more and they get tips. Not sure how you still avoided my point. But to demean people who work in the service industry is not productive.

gt Or maybe I refer to their own statement from the most recent results... gt This tracker will update daily with new polling data about Americans reactions to the coronavirus pandemic. I have no idea what your point is. They do update daily that doesn't mean they aren't a lagging indicator. They simply take today's polls as they are released and include them in their running average which also includes older polls It has the effect of evening out the bumps outliers are averaged out but makes the results lag by a few days if not a week gt Are you really swing Politico is not biased gt With that aside we all have to take polling for what it is...crap Polls aren't biased or crap. Polls are literally math based science. The problem is that the interpretation of the polls can be flawed or biased. In 2016 538 gave Trump about a 25 chance of winning the day before the election. People are idiots and don't understand that 25 0 For every four elections you have with a 75 25 split the underdog will win one. 538 wasn't wrong and the polls weren't wrong. The pollsters just made bad assumptions about who would and wouldn't show up. Also if 538 proposes you should say yes they're the best in the business. They're just not the most current.
you're not wrong.

I really don't understand why some conservatives like on the donald aren't fans of him. I don't care if he was or is a hillary supporter or if he criticizes the president. We just need good experts who are willing to be neutral and talk mostly facts. and call out the media when it tries to soundbite
Yup. That was the exact track we could take..or maybe it was Trigonometry and not Physics....either way I was lazy and took advanced algebra instead of algebra 2 in 10th grade so I took Calculus my senior year.
Thanks It's been about 18... 19... days so far but actually feeling pretty good now. I have an Albuterol inhaler to open my lungs from asthma to clear out the pneumonia. Still feel a little run down but nothing like before. Once I am symptom free 3 days I'm allowed to leave this 12x12ft room I'm in My wife made fun of me when I asked if I could get certified corona free but now it looks like that might actually happen at some point. I'm planning to volunteer to do things like get groceries for high risk people and go to the hospital to help once I recover. Might as well take advantage of those antibodies.
I'm glad you made it. Stay safe fellow redditor.
I'm not sure they're trying to cure it. What's the point of shutting down small businesses at all All that's going to happen is they go bankrupt without any appreciable decline in the infection rate. Spaces likely to result in transmission like public transit call centers etc should be targets but not businesses in general.
I have seen it. You need not go far. They are instigating in every anti Trump thread. And this is what worries me. People in the US need someone to blame. The President is an easy target. But he has been hindered and distracted by the constant abuse from the DNC. This is echoed in the Chinese influenced media. The liberal left is completely deluded right now.
Are you claiming honor and service are not virtues
Most of those guns will wind up in drawers and closets forgotten. They're like radioactive waste just sitting there waiting to be stolen and used in the commission of crimes.
No dying is definitely still worse.
Speaking of an agenda these ships were deployed to take on non infected patients to relieve the hospitals..

Kushner is scary both for his ill assumed roles and for the fact that he seems to lack any kind of humanity period. His eyes are dead and he seemingly has no personality or soul or...really anything. It s terrifying.
if this was obama they were talking about there would be an instant cry for his resignation. therefore trump should IMMEDIATELY resign.
Truth is we don't have capable people in the tech industry... at least not on the scale we need. Public education is a mess because it's horribly funded and tech jobs are still being treated as college careers when they should be handled as trade schools. Yeah work visas suck. No we couldn't just get rid of them without first fixing some underlying problems with the American education system. Problems who's solutions do not involve simply privatizing education.

Yah much like a firework show and just as effective.
Before I start my comment I feel the need to say I strongly disapprove of how this administration has handled this pandemic. But from the few comments I read in that thread I don t strongly disagree with anything I ve seen. And this is a problem these people are providing justification for kushner s comments that really aren t what he or trump mean when they say certain things. In other words people are explaining what he meant when in reality that is just their interpretation of his words and likely not what he actually means. They see things how they like.
I was saying this in January when China had welded their citizens inside their homes and Walmart's shelves were looking empty.
I think it s stupid to celebrate a couple percent of the population for a month. And even dumber that many people expect everyone to be on board. Outside of that I m very against pride. It s one of the seven deadly sins after all.
All the networks do this to an extent right or left. They're all pushing a narrative.
if people die the economy gets hurt also. if people get sick hospitals become full. You know we have other sick people right they are the same as before the pandemic. where will they be treated

Hey Fluffy you running out of current Tulsi stories to post
Hey friend. You are correct despite the down votes. People here are seemingly more concerned with Murica than with what makes America actually free. If government can seize a private business for whatever purposes aside from breaking just laws then we are no longer free. And as stated below based on how we are being commanded to not gather in groups stay at home show our papers to be able to go to essential work etc. I don t think we are free anymore.

Comparing Covid 19 to a seasonal flu and spreading misinformation about the mortality rate. vox.com gl 1 oyc9r7 gt I think the 3. 4 percent number is really a false number. Now this is just my hunch but based on and lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this because a lot of people will have this and it is very mild. They will get better very rapidly they don t even see a doctor or call doctor you never hear about those people so you can t put them down in the category in overall population in terms of this corona flu or virus. So you just can t do that. gt So if you know we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by you know sitting around and even going to work some of them go to work but they get better and then when you do have a death like you had in the state of Washington like you had one in California I believe you had one in New York you know all of a sudden it seems like 3 or 4 percent which is a very high number as opposed to a fraction of 1 percent. gt But again they don t know about the easy cases because the easy cases don t go to the hospital they don t report to doctors or the hospital in many cases so I think that the WHO number is very high. I think the number personally I would say the number is way under 1 percent. gt Now with the regular flu we average from 27 000 to 77 000 deaths a year. Who would think that I never knew that until six or eight weeks ago I asked that question I said How many people die of the flu You know you keep hearing about flu shot flu shot take your flu shot but how many people die of the flu And they said sir we lose between 27 000 and you know somewhere in the 70s I think we went as high as 100 000 people died in 1990 if you can believe that but a lot much people regardless. I think it averages about 36 000 people a year. So I said Wow that is a percentage that is under 1 percent very substantially. So it d be interesting to see what difference is but again a lot of people don t report. The seasonal flu doesn t overwhelm entire hospitals as it is doing in New York and other cities that have been too late to lock down their populations. Once the hospital system is full the general mortality rate of the population explodes because now there are no beds left to treat people for heart attacks strokes car accidents you name it. Trump downplayed the virus and called it a Democratic hoax against him even though he was told in January by the intelligence agencies about the coming pandemic and the collapse of the healthcare system if the virus wasn t contained. He said the cases in the US would go from 15 to 0. That it would magically disappear when the weather heated up. That he would open the country back up by easter. And now he says 120 000 Americans will die. Trump has blood on his hands.

Hard labor Do you think it would be done with pickaxes and shovels and shit The average McDonald s worker works harder than the average major construction worker and significantly harder than skilled trades like electrician plumber or heavy equipment operator. The job is hot the job is fast paced the job absolutely sucks most of the time. It would also teach those bartenders and fast food workers valuable skills whether it be heavy equipment operation electrical pipelining etc. Maybe not all of them would stick it out that s fine it s obvious that fast food workers and grocery store clerks are among our most valuable employees. They re still going to work you see while so many other more important jobs are not. The project would also create manufacturing jobs if we made the materials of both the line and trains in the us along with creating environmentally sound methods of transporting people and cargo across the country. If we expanded transcontinental to merge with existing metro rails and install them in communities that haven t yet we could eliminate a significant among of vehicle traffic while providing excellent paying jobs.

Matthew 7 21 23 gt 21 Not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me Lord Lord did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name 23 And then will I declare to them I never knew you depart from me you workers of lawlessness. Our time here on Earth is to glorify God and tend to what he has given us dominion over. I just cannot wrap my mind around how people can believe God created Earth in it's beauty would be pleased with our obvious abuse over her resources. Or how a God that sent his Son to show mercy compassion grace humility and kindness would find pleasure in our abuse of those outcast and broken. He LITERALLY came for THEM. It's all right there in the scriptures they believe to be true and it hurts my heart how they excuse away their actions that their very beliefs condemns. It's depressing to say the least but that saying if Jesus came back he would be crucified by the very people who say follow him holds more water than ever before..
Mind if I do a J
I ve always spelled it Kruger but yeah.
Unfortunately yes. Our Conservative party has consistently been moving further left during Cameron and May s leadership. Johnson s party is definitely a step back in the right direction though. Another issue is that we don t have a balance of TV media the way the US does. Something as simple as having Fox News provide an alternate view on current events isn t something we have in the UK all of the news channels are differing shades of left. That has an obvious effect on the culture when they all can t help pushing intersectional bullshit at every opportunity. Radio and print are relatively balanced but TV is severely lacking in that department. And ironically the BBC the supposedly neutral public service are the absolute worst.

Yes that is the goal. You see republicans are wildly unpopular amongst the under 35 age range or minorities so anything that reduces overall turnout is considered a good thing.
I agree with this stuff but I think that even giving the ideologies labels and not breaking them down into the component values that make them up limits our thinking. Yeah I agree the roman empire or napoleon's empire or any number of other pre modern governments don't fit fascism perfectly but they incorporated a lot of the same values. So IMO its not Fascism thats the creates problems its the values or some of the values that constitute it. When we attribute the problems to the labels not the values that make up the ideology we end up with hyperbole of the highest order. It becomes much easier to simply change the label of something to fascist than to prove that all the values line up with fascism but both can have profound effects. Just like how sanders' version of socialism is very different from previous forms but have the same label nonetheless. Whats that phrase History doesn't repeat itself but it does rhyme It seems to me to be the case. To me the biggest thing keeping the US from its goals is all the hyperbole and the movement from people thinking the problem is someone else's beliefs to the problem being the people themselves. If you have a conflict over beliefs that can have a happy ending. Beliefs can change. A conflict of perceived good vs evil cannot end well for everyone.

There is zero evidence it helped. I m a doctor I prescribe the stuff.

The cleanup after Trump is... I don't think anyone has even proposed a serious plan to handle it. It's beyond the pale. I've said before I think some of this will take decades to deal with but I'm worried at this point that vast swathes of it will simply be ignored. The sheer number of trials alone that need to be handled is mind boggling far less when you consider there's basically noone left actually skilled at and dedicated to their jobs due to Trump. It's reached the point where even the outrage is normalized. We're so worn down that each individual scandal is quickly forgotten. Who even thinks about Soleimani often these days

Am American and I agree. This is a global economy and Canada is our closest ally. We d be much better off working more closely on streamlining our supply stream. For instance Canada harvesting and exporting more pulp and having US manufacturers create more masks for for both countries. In times of crisis working together would strengthen our bond. Instead we re disrupting our supply chain and Trump s trade advisor is literally saying in a crisis we have no allies wtf
Hope that fucker loses by 20 points
Also probably limited knowledge of the situation. They were already publicly noted as being in port due to an outbreak. Anyone who wanted to know where the ship was and the condition of the crew already knew.

Don t forget that they blame the poor exhausted dude working the entire flight schedule every day from early morning until long after dark and take no responsibility for the accident.

Trump has appointed a person to judge the loyalty of people throughout the government. He is firing long time valuable people because they are not sufficiently obsequious or pro trump enough. It is a Russian purge without bullets. If Trump gets 4 more America will not be the same.

They had the chance to correct this mistake they are suddenly the victims of and abjectly refused to. This is all on them. This was intended from the beginning. They used Trump to get what has been the subject of their wet dreams since Nixon massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations and packing the federal courts with GOP friendly judges so they can continue to skirt the rule of law they so publicly claim is inviolate while violating it at every turn. Yes they're very bold statements and absolutely true and necessary. This piece is just a GOP friendly site trying to deflect blame for the situation the GOP created.

Creat a PPE need website that States can utilize and update their need on a daily basis they could also have State notices on there and other things. This would also help to see were PPE is going. It would help also to keep track of equipment numbers so when a state is done with its peak and levels off they can send equipment to what state needs it most. It would hold everyone accountable for supplies and use. It would creat a central location for information while still keeping specifics of each states guidelines clear.

One sentence is all it takes to demolish a wall of retarded leftist talking points impressive
gt Should Trump talk or let the doctors talk Ideally let his doctors do the talking primarily and have him more or less repeat the points they make. The thing you quoted is not contradictory at all. I very clearly said he should be following the wording of his experts which is not exactly a call for him to do what he usually does. gt What in your opinion would change if say Fauci came out and said we're having promising results from Chloroquine Well for one if he's saying it he's likely not to oversell it even if the preliminary evidence is promising at the moment. He would have said not to assume anything right off the bat rather than after the president mentioned it which would have genuinely tempered the frenzy over acquiring it at least. There's zero shame in a president heavily deferring to experts on issues like this and it would have been much better to begin with if the message was unified and clear rather than having them contradict each other. gt Or in your mind would he just not say the name and journalists wouldn't press him for the name of the drug That should be up to someone like Fauci to decide based on their ability to set the correct expectations. My guess is that he would use this opportunity to name the drug so that he could influence expectations because it would likely be leaked or figured out by someone anyways. There's really no way to argue that the president didn't overstate the drug's promise considering Fauci has been downplaying it ever since. And even if you couldn't completely prevent a shortage less of a shortage is objectively better than a bigger shortage.
Those children wouldn't be here without the illegal alien parents. That is a valid analysis. It even subtracts the estimated amount of taxes illegal aliens pay. It's incredibly exhaustive.

Just like some conservatives think the psycho SJWs who think 8 year olds should have gender reassignment are representative of the left. The difference is more people on the left like your dumb ass are brainwashed into thinking the other side is evil instead of just wrong. I don t think people like you are evil just easily manipulated into believing something based on emotional appeals. And he s your president too unless you leave the country.

The article does a good job reviewing two journalistic sources who visited parts of the stockpile in 2016. It was in very good condition except for some things related to equipping hospitals around the country to deal with the H1N1 viral epidemic that never got replaced afterwards. No doubt due to budgetary restrictions during Obama's administration and tax cuts during Trump's maybe I guess.

Eh. About 26 of eligible voters... 17 of Americans. Also how are you helping anything
Let's take Germany for example. Germany has nationalised healthcare unemployment pay unions if your buisness is big enough you have to have union members at your board free or inexpensive education paid sick leave at least 24 paid vacation days a lot of companies do more paid maternity leave paid overtime Ca. 40 hour work weeks etc. Germaniens per capita income is ca. 40. 000 and americas is 60. 000. If you are unemployed and worked long enough before that you get 80 of the average of your last three months of income for up to two years to get a proper job and not be forced to take the first offer. If you have cancer that can set you back up to 150. 000 dollars in the US and over 34 get cancer in their life time. The average German would pay less in healthcare in his working life then an American would pay for one bad cancer treatment. That most other doctor appointments and treatments would also be paid for isn't included. An average American pays more for his healthcare and treatments in his life time then an average Canadian. Is that because in Canada fewer people get ill or because if everyone is ensured by the gouvernemt the gouvernemt has a monopoly and keep prizes low and healthcare more affordable The US is the only country where something like healthcare is socialised and bad. The conservatives in Germany don't even talk about it because it is seen as normal and good regardless of your political standpoint. Something that costs the average person less keeps more people healthy is morally right good for the economy the person can work and spend the money on goods other then healthcare and good for the average wallet. Would you conclude that the fourth largest economy is lazy because they also have those benefits or the third largest economy Japan is lazy because they have those benefits or the rest of the developed countries except the US are lazy because they have most of those benefits Edit added a few more benefits

Science and evidence don't operate on polls. The US president recommending a drug that's has not been fully tested is not only irresponsible but naive.

I would really like to see that as well. I'm not against the idea of the government temporarily getting ownership in a private company with the idea that the company will acquire the equity back at a higher price but I do not support the nationalization of anything and everything. There's so much noise on Reddit that its hard to filter the signal through the noise. The screeching from r politics makes it really hard for discourse IMHO. r politics would be wise to appoint mods of different biases and introduce a concept of Featured Comments similar to NYT and WSJ and expose users of Reddit to highly rated answers from different perspectives.

Cruel people exist. The real problem is that 40 of Americans actually like him. Otherwise Donald doesn't exist. He would still be living in his bubble of ass kissers lies a bullying.
gt Genuinely curious what brings you to a conservative sub Down the rabbit hole I guess gt Go start arguments there instead. Also some of us think putting millions into poverty is not the best idea. Yeah neither is killing off our population for the sake of the economy. I'm not saying it's the best idea to fuck the economy but you cant be ignorant and ignore the lives of people. gt You have to think about the repercussions of things other than just regurgitating buzzwords you're hearing on CNN I am thinking about the repercussions of lives. Buddy I do my research and dont refence biased new sources. I listen to credited doctors.
Agreed. I do not want my healthcare in the governments care and would much rather it be private insurance. I know a lot of people are pushing for M4A universal but all of those countries healthcare systems are slowly collapsing and introducing private health insurance. But it NEEDS to complete and be on our side.
That's not how reddit works tard.
Yeah they're probably all getting big money out of this 2 trillion dollar stimulus bill.
Have you ever seen that YouTube video of the rifle being dropped and the soldier getting bayoneted in the foot He flinches and then continues on as if he weren't bleeding. That's impressive
Apparently being the king of Thailand gets you a luxury German hotel to yourself with however many concubines you want. You Lysol those ladies and it could be pretty safe.
I only killed 250000 Americans That had a good ring to it
Quit your bullshit. Bernie should vote for a third party candidate.
We won't know until this is over. The issue with this virus is survival is strongly dependent on level of care and with the utter clusterfuck that Trump and company made with the initial organization and the way they've dragged their feet in implementing measures that could flatten the infection curve the medical system is headed for collapse. orldometers.info This probably won't peak until the end of April or early in June and we'll be looking at tens of millions of cases by then.
To be fair I didn't think Americans would put up with the police arresting people for going to church but here we are.
Also banning plastic bags led to the homeless street poop crisis.
Fucking hell. I have no doubt you're right but... there are just no words.
4 5 people enjoy gang rape.
Exactly. Even if it was effective you d still need to know all the parameters. Otherwise you may well end up killing more people with the cure than would ever have died from the actual disease.
Well that s good. I can imagine some mutual aid calls if you are at least close enough to a larger population center. Regardless stay am safe.

I actually loathe saying this but if Romney was president I would feel a whole lot better than I do right now.
Now I know how to make it rich Run for president as the a far left socialist candidate. Promise the most insane things like free college healthcare housing 20 minimum wage a government so expansive that even the sexual positions you practice in the bedroom require government approval. Promise uber Social Justice. Have a platform that makes extreme SJWs of today look like moderates. Gets millions in campaign donations. Lose the nomination to a real Democrat. Buy a couple homes a super car. Write a novel about how I made it rich promising the impossible to brain dead college students.
Do you get upset at people for being proud to be American That s pride... so technically it s a sin. Personally the only emotion I have is shame like a REAL catholic christian
That s obviously and clearly not goi not going to protect us forever. He should have considered that his intelligence officials back in January that told him that China was lying and gotten a plan to get the proper PPE and ventilators to American hospitals.

Quite frankly I hope that plays out to be true if you catch my drift. Maybe the second amendment people will have something to say about it
So you re a fan of his
Same. Anybody paying enough attention to vote for Bernie can see the harm in letting Trump win again.
She came down with it last Thursday. By Saturday they were rushing her to the ER as she couldn't breath. By Wednesday this week she was able to breath on her own.
This close to the election and with the pandemic the GOP propaganda machine would have a field day if the Dems tried. I am not saying he doesn't deserve it for multiple things since but our best bet is to vote him out. My fear is they are already rigging that as well.
This sentiment is why people hate politics and don't participate.

Obstruction of future investigations by intimidation.
gt causing unnecessary panic. In other words anyone who sees the reality and wants to inform. This administration demands absolute unquestioning loyalty yet suppresses and punishes anyone who points out simple facts. And people will die.
Not for nothing but your first paragraph sufficiently explains the answer to the reasoning of your second paragraphs premise without having to speculate about other factors. You could be correct of course but the additional layer of duplicity is unnecessary in this case because we're talking about the most recent worst fucking senator to ever exist.
Yes
Kushner or Trump
Honestly I don t know
They sure gave them 25 million. Who s to say they re helping the people who are struggling more than they re helping them self s
Way too much faith
I understand why you would characterize her as such but allow me to propose a thought experiment say you believed that vast injustices were being committed to the benefit of a select few. You've been studying and pondering ways to fix the situation and then suddenly you're in a position where you have the ability to fix it and the people you interact with seem to support you. Would you not behave the same way Or would you sit silently while you presumably become part of the corrupt system as your inaction becomes compliance
He s great avoiding accountability.
Nah best to shine a light on the straight up incompetence that is leading us now.

Stop the fear mongering. We have a real estate developer in charge here.
We're having this debate in the uk. We get our labour for fruit picking mostly from Eastern Europe. With massive unemployment at the moment it's a no brainer to recruit locally among British residents to fill these jobs. But the left here thinks we need to keep importing migrants from Europe despite there being massive labour supply here. Go figure.
Alright dude. I m not gonna try to make you understand how things work. You seem determined not to understand. You remind me of me when I was 14.
You can message me if this turns into impeachment and I ll order you a pizza. I m willing to admit I might be wrong.

Sorry that I dont just buy into the anti Russian propaganda that America has been pumping out since the cold war.
Oh fuck she's still in this.

Also from what Ive read alot of the fiber in the mask comes from Canada as well.
If you think government is a solution you have no idea how authoritarianism works. Our rights as humans are far more important than any facade of safety the government wants to sell you on. Standing up for our rights is the opposite of inaction.
Oh please let that be real.
Not even sure I was going to attribute it but I've seen to many names and I'm having a nice glass of wine on the deck and didn't want to bother
So this is what Kushner obviously suggested Trump should do...we wondered why he was so slow he had to figure out how he could make money off it first.
You notice that the only jobs out there are essential right And they wouldn t hire people unless they desperately need someone. Unless you think driving pallets of food to grocery stores is not essential. If that s the case I feel sorry for you.
Their hospitals are less prepared for the surge in patients. Most rural hospitals are only really fit to stabilize and transfer to a city where they have specialists available.
Yes I was a Nuke RO back in the day early to mid 90s
I ve never once purchased any style of paid preview fight on tv. I ve always thought it to be too expensive and I m pretty much a peaceful person.

I agree. Both Trump and these people shouldn t have done what they did.
Yes alot of Americans want the purge. We are a big country though. The current administration are domestic terrorists. We desperately need changes
That is indeed what it is for

Stop president basing that's unamerican......fuk Obama
The State seems to go for the most woke the most flashy and its citizens are paying the price in more than just tax dollars. There is a lack of strategic thinking in NY State government and an inability to either set priorities or do rational analysis. Cuomo has also diverted over 10 Billion of taxpayer money in public funding and tax breaks since 2011 for ill conceived businesses like Central New York Film Hub outside Syracuse which cost 15 million to build but was sold last month for just 1 or a solar plant as part of the Buffalo Billion It was to employ over 3 000 workers cost 750 million but only employs 700 that's over 1 million per job On top of that Tesla now runs it and it is likely to be shut down. The State built a light bulb factory for 90 million with a deal to lease the facility to the manufacturer for 1 year. Factory built no tenant.
Coronovirus articles are NOT paywalled.
And it can contaminate semen so even the whole only women are in control of fetus health argument is wrong.
you're implying something. say it.
I completely agree. I lean left as an independent and think the same of at least some members of the Democratic Socialist faction within the Democratic party. If they manage to take over the party as well then at the federal level we'll have two diametrically opposite and extreme parties that each only represent a small minority of Americans. That's the worst possible situation imo and I just hope party leadership on both sides are strategically clever enough to maneuver around it in the long term.
What do you want us to do Rally in DC and get covid 19 or get shot by a fucking M1 Abrams We don t have much control over our government over here.
You need to understand the preppers or at least understand they have been preparing for the end of times since Obama was going to create a dictatorship and take away everyone's guns. Someone is making money off of these idiots with guns.

Here's another one extrapolation is very difficult regardless of how granular your models are. Statistical significance requires data and data is a rare commodity these days.
Fucking hope not. I ll vote Biden before we become socialist. I m not republican or dem but I own a small business and work for another small business and socialism seriously effects middle class business owners and working citizens. I get it. People want free health care. People want free education and better paying jobs and all these great things that really would help. But the problem is they seriously eliminate the middle class. And that leaves just low class and high class.
Don't forget the ventalitors don't work either
So you d rather some other country gets help before your own

And China does have it under control after their Hubei lockdown. In which thousands of people died sacrificed themself to give the rest of China and the world more time to prepare and battle this virus. China doesn't have many new local cases. Almost all are now from people coming into the country. So China needs to deal with that now. I don't really understand China bashing here on r conservative. If there is one country that's conservative then it's China

Is it necessarily wrong to present videos of only chinese people Especially when it appears they are the nationality committing the majority of these I think it is raising the issue that a decent amount of chinese people are intentionally spreading the virus. Which is very concerning and raises questions.
STOP VOTING FOR TRUMP Right wingers have a vested interest in tying your patriotism and service to their party but they don't care about you Look at candidates and issues objectively. Vote based on a candidate's history in and out of the public eye who actually wants to try and make things better

Complete loss of appetite sense of smell and taste. Heavy rash on my back that looked like in between chicken pox and measles and the list goes on. Every time I try to return to normal activity my lungs start to click again
This one is not looking good for Trump. His campaign team is already threatening to sue TV stations that air the footage of him referring to the virus as a democrat hoax And yes the impeachment happened still while the virus was in it's early stages but it's hard to say that this distracted Trump since he never went to any of the hearings or the trial. Also he golfed 8 times during it all. It's not all bad news Trump's travel ban to china was a good move but it was followed up by a long series of blunders. The travel ban doesn't justify everything else that took place after like lack of testing lying that testing would be readily available saying the virus was like the flu saying it would probably be gone by April that we had 15 cases soon to be zero and Trump flip flopping a few times on the seriousness of the virus.... to name a few
Everyone can get aids too. It was IV drug users and it was a clean needle program. The fact that only certain people matter is disgusting.
Joe is fundraising for his presidential campaign. Bernie doesn't have to do that anymore since he's never going to be president. Nothing a dictator apologist says is credible.

That s not a free market. You can t have it both way. You either support a free market or you believe that corporations are beholden to the state. A business is in it to make a profit. Morality ethics and national Identity don t matter when that is the ultimate goal. This is Capitalism.
No no no you guys are missing the point. Which is that they had two options. One was to stay and the other was not to stay. They decided to stay.
And I will bc it's not about me it's about the future generations. We still have laws and federal welfare benefits that are still on books from the Great Depression the last big pandemic So the things that are done now will effect future generations more than us.
Just think about this guys. If we all would have stayed home for like two weeks back in the end of January we would be totally fine right now. Except this is turning into the largest shit storm since WWII. Please just look at the numbers and how this virus affects overweight individuals this will ravage America.

Except that this is more deadly than the flu. It's much more contagious than the flu. You can get it without the carrier showing symptoms. NY hospitals are nearly over run. If my rural state doesn't take measures soon each small town could be a breeding ground for future waves. Just because you aren't seeing the level of death you could be seeing without these shelter in place orders does not mean the orders are doing nothing. There is a point to slowing the spread but we can't do it indefinitely our economy can't take it.

You re an idiot. What happens when America ceases all exports Nobody sends them the supplies needed to manufacture the masks and guess what The main reason we can t produce enough is because we don t have enough material in the first place. This would have a complete opposite effect and would be bad for the Americans

Nepotism is a bad way to handle a subway restaurant. You don t run a government like this.
The data you seek won't be available until we have serology tests. Your requirements are exceptionally strict that we need protective equipment and tests for everybody. That's not plausible. We will never have that. It's expected that the number of actual infections are 1 or maybe 2 orders of magnitude higher than the official infection rate.
It s retaliation pure and simple.
Trump is shirking responsibility.
San Diego too
What is this
You have that backwards. The house picks the president the senate the vp
Yea I mean that's what trump said in the beginning lol
Again s is obvious here. What is wrong with you people
Fact is that it didn't look promising from the start. Trump was basing his statement on a very questionable study. Now we've seen better studies but it's still not such a big deal for experts. There are more promising things out there with fewer side effects. It certainly isn't the promised wonder drug.

Your rantings did not answer my question. By what right do you have any claim on what I earn The willingness to turn your life and that of your family over to some non medical party apparatchik is baffling to me. The willingness to give up any and all choice in who gives you care or does your life saving procedure that baffles me. The willingness to wait 12 18 months for routine procedures and then get a luck of the draw surgeon baffles me. The willingness of your ilk to force me through the politicians you hope to elect to pay for your ideals. Despite the persistent myth the rest of the words has not figured it out By every OBJECTIVELY measurable standard the US leads the world in outcomes medical R amp D drug R amp D. There is a reason that the world s wealthy who could go ANYWHERE in the world come primarily to the US for anything serious. You know nothing of the Scandinavian countries you claim have it figured out Many of their policies are antithetic to the Bernie crowd except for free healthcare and college. Denmark No minimum wage. Very rigid immigration policies you know the kind Trump is racist for desiring Very lax business regulation. Tiny country of very homogeneous people. Quite capitalistic economic policies. The government can t run the post office the DMV Social Security the VA all proven failures. Yet you want to give them another big social program to fuck up No thanks. Instead of messing with the American way of life why don t you just move to Venezuela or Cuba or some other socialist paradise and leave us be. Everyone would be happy.

What's a bizarre article. It used a bunch of anecdotal evidence attacking Trump and then points this out at the end gt It s true that some of the supplies in the stockpile that governors are currently asking the government to send to states were not completely restocked during Obama s presidency. gt For example the Washington Post reported on March 10 that the reserves of the N95 respirator masks were not significantly restored after tens of millions of the devices were distributed from the stockpile during the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009. Medical personnel wear the respirators because they can filter out at least 95 of airborne particles according to the Food and Drug Administration. gt Greg Burel who was the director of the Strategic National Stockpile for more than 12 years until he retired in January recently told CBS News We didn t receive funds to replace those masks protective gear and the anti virals that we used for H1N1. IE the cupboard was bare of the supplies we needed because Obama didn't refill them. In all fairness Trump didn't refill them either but we don't have any evidence he was ever alerted to the fact that they were gone. You can't expect the President to deal with a problem he has no way of knowing exists.
lol come on. We don t ban cars because all car accidents dont happen rapidly in a single short time frame requiring hospital care. The flu season doesnt cause anywhere close to the degree of hospitalization per unit time. How do i know because clearly NYC has car accidents has a flu season and it was nowhere close to being this limited and underresourced as now. Do you think all the physicians and nurses are just lying and that suddenly all the patients coming in requiring ventilators was no different than the regular flu season. I m not trying to antagonize you but the problem isnt whether the death rate is marginally higher than the flu its that its happening so fast and requiring resources instantly. I dont care about liberal or conservative viewpoints why label ourselves as such. This is a matter of thinking about the problem and trying to come up with a solution. We are all impacted by the economic downturn I agree we need a different solution. But to downplay covid s potential impact and to disregard the countless experts on the topic is foolish.

The White House instead rejected the prospect of allowing new sign ups across the 38 Affordable Care Act marketplaces it controls a decision that shocked the health care industry triggered widespread criticism and prompted a scramble within the administration to find a new way to care for the growing population left exposed to the pandemic.

Okay so when the US is reliant on other countries to import necessities in cases like this do you think it's a smart idea to stop exports when it would prompt other countries to do this to us

gt When are college students going to get some relief Many of us are pulling loans you already did. you got 1200 and your student loans along with the interest are on hold. if you're unemployed you're also getting another 600 week extra 2400 month
Because she is a zealot. Look up the definition and you may understand but from your condescending attitude I feel you may be the same.
Obviously its satire. Its about the way its presented in the sub and the comments
Oh come on. The only thing he would do differently is issue an executive order banning abortion throughout the US.
Why not vote by mail
That's my first reaction. Fauci is the last thread keeping pandemonium away from the whole country. We're so fucked
Protest
gt Bernie did really well considering how strongly the big media outlets tried to make him go away. No he didn't he got decimated. His campaign failed to reach out to moderate voters and banked everything on a youth that never showed up.
As I predicted now that this looks like a real treatment you have the media pretending that they not only never criticized Trump for suggesting this but refusing to state that this is the drug he recommended at all. You should have seen Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC today dancing around this so fast I'm shocked she didn't throw out a hip.
Aww we women only have rights when we can murder babies is that it Otherwise we're just stuck in the kitchen cooking these guys their tendies.
Ah yeah... two states whoa I don t want trump to win but am disappointed with the options.
So instead he sits there stumbling through the reading like one of the slow kids we used hate to see called upon to read aloud. Cringey.
Yep. And the way to prove it is to take a long nap inside your running car in the garage.
This but unironically. I disagree with 90 of the shit in this thread as my two previous comments prove. But China's irresponsible handling of this pandemic recklessly fucking with the data and trying to supress the information instead of the virus while allowing the unsanitary wet markets that caused this to happen on the first place is what caused tens of thousands of deaths worldwide and many more on the months to come. If the rest of the world had enough leverage instead of being little bitches that depend on them for manufacturing I would advocate for sanctions until every single one of those markets is closed and every CCP politician that tried to hide info is in jail. But that's just a fantasy and they'll continue business as usual.
The worst part is helping citizens isn't even the thought process behind this. This is all wild flailing to help that orange sack of shits election campaign.
youtu.be
How about he suspends his campaign so people don't need to go out to vote against him and risk the virus.
Patriot act anyone
When are people going to start pushing back on this shit
gt He needs to make up for the billions and billions and billions of dollars he would have made laundered for the Russians had he not been president. It s only fair.
If I had an extra mask I would probably not give it to schifty.
gt before announcing to the world that it was the wonder drug No one did this. This is why I downvoted you.
So yes you're suggesting that a 4 income tax would bankrupt people like a 100 000 bill from medical treatments... so... if you say so sure.
Who is this guy again What is his official role and how did het get it
You get how retarded you sound right
Mike Huckabee signed on for the Trump 2024 campaign in December. It's already happening my dude. gt Greatly honored to be asked to chair realDonaldTrump re election campaign for POTUS in 2024. Gives me lots of time to plan By then the Dems wil no longer be a political party in America replaced by the New Whig Party. twitter.com s 20
IIRC you can get arrested in some very specific places if you re intentionally trying to get other people sick or break quarantine in some places particularly places where the pandemic has hit the hardest.
I have faith in Dr. Fauci. I can't wait for the lawsuits that drive FOX ENTERTAINMENT not news out of business. Mr. Murdoch we're coming for you
He increases taxes on the rich. You and your jetski dealership will be fine.
Having Robert Kraft around sure is... handy.
This is further proof that the whole pro life movement is really just about controlling women. These fucks don t give two shits about saving lives.
Why should we celebrate saint patricks
Um...governors are. The congress just put up with him to pass a bill that the country really needs. But you are right. I can t believe he has such a positive response. Wait until all of Florida is dead.
I love my job and am happy with my life. I m just trying to deliver the gift of reality to my fellow man. Hope it s been beneficial for you.
The internet remembers i.redd.it And even hardcore leftist fact checkers debunked snopes.com the hoax' talking point.
Will they downvote you into oblivion for disagreeing with them
It is truly bizarre reading liberals lose their collective shit about Russia sending supplies. Just remember that these people will cut their nose to spite their face time after time
You re unacceptable
It took me far to long to realize this was satire
Technically Patrick Leahy of Vermont becomes president. As stated...it s complicated.
gt Though initially passed in response to the Korean War the DPA is historically based on the War Powers Acts of World War II. Gradually Congress has expanded the term national defense as defined in the DPA. Based on this definition the scope of DPA authorities now extends beyond shaping U.S military preparedness and capabilities as the authorities may also be used to enhance and support domestic preparedness response and recovery from natural hazards terrorist attacks and other national emergencies. So yeah you don't need to be engaged in conventional war with another country to invoke it. All that remains is agreement on wether you think the coronavirus epidemic constitutes a national emergency requiring extraordinary measure to safeguard the lives of Americans. If you don't think so then we have a difference of opinion which is perfectly fine
Always Trumps fault.

I think the only thing that needs to be said here is Chris Cuomo is a dick so its likely he is being a dick here too.
That's why the Democrats want to decriminalize illegal immigration and ensure that criminal illegal aliens are not deported right because they care so very much about the American citizens whose wages the illegals depress and the American citizens who are victims of the crimes they commit or are you arguing that American citizens aren't their constituents.

I don't KNOW I have COVID 19. You don't KNOW if you have COVID 19. The vast majority of the population does not have COVID 19. Only some people have COVID 19. Yet you believe the government should be able to force all of these individuals into their homes under penalty of law violating the 1st Amendment on the chance they DO have COVID 19 and they accidentally pass it onto someone who may be more suspecible than they. How do you not see that as unreasonable unconstitutional and government overreach I'm not being a monster by suggesting that our rights should remain as is. And you can't seem to differentiate between INTENTIONALLY infecting another person and ACCIDENTALLY doing so. What about someone who already had COVID 19 They are now immune. They cannot pass it into anybody. They cannot even be a carrier. Why are they having their rights taken away Rights are a restriction on government not on you. If the government can take them just because something bad is happening then we don't really have them. Let the Constitution stand.
gild. Not a word you see very often anymore but that was a solid use of it.
So it s ok if the states do it. Gotcha. Doesn t sound very free markets oriented but your principles may vary. You act like we ll always have the option of buying from other countries. That s a luxury and this pandemic has shown us that it can and will be taken from us. This pandemic is precisely why I think the global economy is a failed experiment. I ve always defended it in the past. I wasn t even a fan of Trumps trade war with China. But since we re playing pretend in my magic world we d drop the restrictions on American companies and allow them to compete on an even playing field with China. No minimum wage. No forced employee benefits. Just literally let the market decide who gets paid what. Safety restrictions and other red tape are also gone. Then our products wouldn t be 10x the cost. Win win right
you know for sure where a ballot goes after it's put into the box please be specific on how you know for sure.

Looks like you ve missed my question again and moved the goalposts. I don t know why you re having such a hard time with my question about your original argument
Exactly this is all the Dems fault. They practically made Trump and his administration downplay the virus from day 1.
Me too regarding the visuals when I had the flu. Akin to an LSD trip at some points.
There can be hundreds of people there watching and it s dead quiet minus the guard s feet tapping on the pavement.
Will any of those things change their behavior Doubtful. Now we should probably do them anyway for our benefit.
I think looking at the 1918 flu response and recovery in the US is a probably a more relevant model. That was around the Russian revolution time too. I feel like the world is sitting in that kind of spot it just doesn t really know it yet. In 6 months with bodies everywhere EVERYONE will be singing a different tune. Perhaps a song of angry men.
She sought to profit from the suffering of others. She invested money in businesses that made medical supplies such as face masks and ventilators. She knew ahead of time what would go down. It's called INSIDER TRADING. I hope Ms. Goldilocks goes to prison.
I travel across the country maintaining power plant control systems. Pretty essential job if you ask me. There is no way for me to do my job except on site as the controllers are air gapped from the internet for obvious reasons. I jump from state to state so often that I have to travel light. The hotel rooms I stay at sometimes don t have microwaves or refrigerators. I have to rely heavily on restaurants to feed myself. Right now it s obviously just drive thru and takeout. But if it weren t for that I d have a hard time getting a decent meal put together consistently. There are many other actually essential workers out there like truckers field servicemen etc that cannot rely on having a kitchen amp pantry to make meals from all the time.
His Excellency President Dr Trump our lord and saviour please use his full title.
Let them get coronavirus relief from their own country.
For one thing they guard it from being vandalized and graffiti. Secondly it is an act to honor those who have fallen in service to this Nation. The Guards also enforce a respectful atmosphere around the Tombs. The Guards consider it a Honor to do this job.
You didn't read the article did you You just read the title and got mad.
Yep. We get it you're not voting for Biden and probably not voting at all. Ok. Moving on
Ok I hear you. I really do. And I'm aware of how she became a conservative. She did realize after trying to setup that website how hypocritical the left was and their game and did change her political views. But it doesn't matter how you change your political views. Things happen that have you open your eyes and it can instantly set you on a different path which it did. And you say you can't really do a 180 on your political views overnight Sure you can. Maybe not if you are a hard core leftists who know what they believe and why they believe it. But not to someone who isn't really political who hasn't really spent too much time on the ideologies of the two. Who just believes the basic narrative but beyond that doesn't look into it too deeply. People in that situation aren't ideological but just associate with a standard way of thinking however dont really know what they believe. People like this can surely change on the turn of a dime. And after you realize how you are being manipulated to follow a certain ideology that you never even really looked into yourself like that you wake up and start to shift your political views. In the process you start to study the ideology on the otherside and do start to understand what you believe. Candace may have identified as a liberal at first but that doesn't make you ideological. Plenty of people identify as liberal left or progressive but don't understand a thing about the ideology itself. People like this can change overnight with just being presented with new information and have an open enough mind. Now I think she got wrapped up in the ego a bit. But that is human nature when you gain the spotlight. It doesn't make you disingenuous. I myself thought too much of what she was doing was fueled on rage for a bit and still is. But it doesn't make her fake or someone who doesn't believe what she makes it seem like what she believes. And she does have certain qualities that would allow her to succeed in politics. As long as she scales back a little on the anger and rage which I'm sure she would if in the political arena However I don't believe she is a fraud. My appeal to her has always been how she takes it to the left. I'm a sucker for that I admit. Personally I'm way less conservative and more about despising the left. I feel that the left is completely out of control and must be stopped. That is bottom line for me. And because of that I defend conservatism and will to the end. And almost every aspect of conservatism even if at my core I disagree with a lot of conservatism. So how conservative do I believe candace is Not sure deep down. But you can defend conservatism with every last breath even if you aren't conservative in all aspects at your core.
Laws are passed and orders are given to violate the constitution all the time. An unconstitutional law does not give them the authority to violate your rights.
you posted the whole quote for context and pasted 1 line of quote and 3 lines of editorializing. Your whole quote even ends in a comma... Like come on man.
yeah thats a fair point...wish i didnt get downvoted for asking a question lol
Pass a law to only sell what the US doesn t buy.

We don't need no baseball. Our national game down here is called diggin. Diggin a big ditch. A ditch of hope which will eventually flood into a river of freedom. From coast to coast cutting us off from the 47 oppressors to the north. Soon the nation of Florida will break off from the mainland and float out to sea. When we are floatin out in the carribean sea singing kumbaya in the sunshine we'll be free to run things our way. There wont be any long ass line at the log flume. We will have a rollercoaster for each and every Florida family. You and the kids will be able to ride the rides all day. No School No Tax Free barbecue and pinball for everyone Sophisticated entertainment I tell you what.
Fuck. Literally just spit out my water at this. Bravo. Lmao
Agreed its the sickest I've ever been and not like I expected. Did you hurt near consistantly and have bone jarring muscle spasms from fever chills
29mil Twitter followers for Trump 115mil for Obama LOL
Great I'm looking forward to getting reparations from the socialists who unleashed this virus.

What a shit fucking website ads all in the way and keeps reloading making the ads come back. Couldn t even read the article
lol then Canada can just stop letting America know when those pesky Russian planes are heading America s way.
Why are you specifying Democrat mayors as if Republican ones are doing better. They are doing far far worse lmao. Pathetic biased cuck
Wait... isn t calling it the Spanish Flu racist I can t keep up with these rules guys.

Fucking bootlickers. The person who doesn't want to risk getting sick can stay home nobody is stopping them.
Take pity upon KDowny he is too ignorant to understand anything
In my department at a very large company over 20 of our employees are H1B visas. If they do any reduction in employees it absolutely needs to be these employees before any US citizen.
A straw man. I don t call lunatics my friends. You can t expect to have a productive dialogue if you don t share a bit of charity to the other view.
Yeah if you want to see how crazy people are getting read the comments on my other posts... It's insane. I'm losing hope for humanity.
So who's controlling the media then I thought the leftist media was full of Jews. Now you are telling me that leftists are anti semetic. If you can just tell me who we are supposed to hate that would be a big help.
What does he meant to mean
It is our stock pile to quid pro quo with. Trump said the quiet part out loud last week. They have to be nice to us though
I don't know but I live in Canada and we're doing it here. I'm not trying to sound smug I'm just saying our government figured something out.
That's a good plan. I might move up the the upper peninsula and see if Canada will take us.
I m guessing that maybe his name was floated by as part of the IG oversight committee for the Corona Relief Plan. He doesn t like the current IG pool no problem. Just fire the ones he can replace with more minions. I m gonna go look it up. Will let you know.
I still don t know that smell. I did however play rugby and I remember how my gear reeked. That s what you re trying to convey right
Well and furthermore I'm quite certain Franklin would have supported taking measures to prevent a pandemic. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
I'm less certain of that every day.
Yeah me too. I just don t think he is being dishonest. I have nothing but sympathy for anyone that contracts this virus. He will probably be fine. But what if he isn t fine What if god forbid he dies. This entire thread would seem quite evil. I just don t think going after Cuomo for embellishment is appropriate. There are so many legit things to attack. This should be off limits for anyone regardless of political ideology.
I'm in rural CA. Been mail in voting for the last 25 years and my Congressional rep is My Kevin McCarthy so it's not as if the process is skewed against the gops. Alas.
These grand crimes and acts of corruption are being supported by functionaries who receive the call and then do the ground level manipulations. I get that there's pressure but them falling in line or worse taking pride in their role as low level accomplices is a profile in cowardice.
Correct. And as a white male landowner I see the trend as a win for everyone.
This is the alternative you don't need healthcare if you are dead
He was a billionaire businessman long before he was president. You just can't get past your hatred for the man to see what's been going on for decades. He was rich before he got into office. A lot of politicians weren't rich until they got into office. I'll take Trump over what we've had any day.
It s because I m a misogynist.
Your comment might not be as relevant as you think it is.
Well for starters if you give all of the high skill good paying jobs to people who are not citizens you screw over your qualified citizens. Not just the ones who would have applied for that job but everyone. You drive down the wages of a particular job to the point where Americans can not take that job because they won't be able to pay their bills. This is only a problem because we allow companies to import cheap foreign labor. Right now companies have to do very little to prove there is a worker shortage. Mostly they create job listings and offer a ridiculously low salary. Then they claim there are no qualified Americans to do that job because no one is willing to work 60 hours a week for twenty five grand a year.
I went to high school with her. Never heard her say a mean thing about anyone. She is a great person.
This is real life not fiction. You're being intellectually dishonest even positing something that clearly is not remotely factual.
can confirm. Family member was just fired but has a 2 year 20 mile non compete. Sure we could hire lawyer to fight it but that is hard to do without having income coming in.
Well bars and stuff are closed. Anything considered nonessential really. But i'm just saying the reason why liquor stores staying open provides a net benefit.
Sorry about Trump from someone living in California. I don t understand him either. Hope you and yours are staying safe.
Chuck Schumer is a shithead. That being said this is playground level antics. Both of them need to shut up. If you don't like each other don't make it public nobody cares. You both have a job to do shut up and do your jobs.
Who s the youngest to lose to it
You do you pal leave the thinking to others.
Seeing as Trudeau just handed a fortune to amazon for distributing medical supplies Trudeau is officially in cahoots with something greater that we dont understand and he cant be trusted. We're all going to paying through the teeth to international business so that they can benefit from this crisis it is becoming so bloated Canada will be in 2nd world territory during recovery. Furthermore the bailout all the money being distributed to Canadians and businesss will paid for through quantitative easing something Canada has never done even during 2008 09. Note facilitating the easing the Bank of Canada has contracted Blackstone Americas most notorious corporation.
gt Republicans are killing poor Americans. fixed that for you
Do you also browse r AskATrumpSupporter If anyone feels like they are going to miss out on the Olympics they can go see some gold metal mental gymnastics. Every time I think there s no way to twist something into a favorable light for Trump I inevitably end up feeling like I went through the spin cycle in my washer.
Shapiro is not a libertarian hes right unity edit sorry i thought this was pcm. right unity for those of you that don't know is between libertarian right and authoritarian right
You classified them as shitholes. They prop up entire states with their federal tax. Hell any counties outside of the greater NYC area and Long Island in NY state are propped up by NYC's state taxes. Far from shitholes.

You are confusing the comparison with the principle. Both HIV and COVID 19 are infectious diseases.
Chill dude I like to have conversations with people from the entire political spectrum. I also enjoy the occasional trolling just as much as the next guy. What do you think 3M should do Should the govt. force them to produce masks for the US only
I agree to an extent. My main concern is that while Biden seeks to make compromise with the good we will only shift the overton window further to the right Fox news will continue lying and slandering the left while CNN and MSNBC intentionally leave out the real impactful news that would have you question the actions of the DNC. Biden tells wealthy donors that nothing fundamentally will change which to me says that he intends to carry on the exact same system that led this country to the catastrophe that is trump.
Wow I'm so glad my tax dollars are spent on military soldiers defending long buried corpses... How fiscally responsible And clearly an essential service
I liked the blonde squealing But they re dying Dr. Fauci. People are dying and need this drug now
Donald Trump is killing people. A thousand are dying each day. Millions will die because of his incompetence and ignorance. This is what happens when Republicans elect a reality TV clown to play president
Look at his approval rating She s right
Turns out even if he rapes women the media doesn't give a shit. Nor the people. You Americans are sad. And you in particular are even sadder. Unless you're a millionaire you have nothing to gain with Biden's possible in the primaries.
You got me wrong bro I am against the chemical I believe in Dr. Fauci
Primaries aren't like General Elections. The parties are running elections to decide who best represents their team. So the candidates all want to win but all of them are still on the same team and want to achieve their common goals so it makes sense to be careful about damaging their own side. It's quite common for candidates in primaries to step down for the good of the team and endorse someone once they realize they have no chance of winning. Only Sanders supporters seem to not get this or think it's rigging or suspicious. It's like people on a boat arguing over who should lead them to shore. There may be bitter disagreements but everyone on the boat understands that they have to make a decision and unite behind it even if it isn't their personal choice because they need to use all their time and resources effectively as a group to survive. Sanders is the equivalent of the guy whose group is in a clear minority with no chance of winning fairly but he's holding on to one of the paddles and demanding that the group revote over and over even though they are running out of food. Meanwhile a subset of his supporters are saying they'd rather set fire to the boat than see anyone but him lead the boat. This is sort of par for the course for Sanders. He just doesn't get the give and take of group action. He's never really participated in any group in his life where he had any responsibility to the group. He's always joined associations and demanded they show a responsibility toward him but he's never been willing to show loyalty in the other direction. His supporters see this as him being consistent. Others see it as him being a rigid asshole who takes and doesn't give anything back.
Heres a prescription of thoughts and prayers. Now get the fuck out of my hospital
Even if you don't file if you had taxes withheld from your paycheck as an illegal you've paid some. Though since form I 9 was introduced I don't know who would be deducting taxes for someone who's ineligible to file a return. I guess someone who was legal and their status has lapsed might still be employed and having taxes withheld since it's not periodically re verified.
Not sure why they are on the same team.
Common sense as a rationale for removal of constitutional rights is not an argument. Common sense also includes If you don't want to get sick don't do things that lead to getting sick don't point guns at everyone else and make them stay home so you don't get sick. I was actually referencing your freedom of assembly which is literally guaranteed legally not some wishy washy sentiment. 2 of the population estimate is at risk of death from a disease. Do you A Quarantine those 2 of people who actually have a self motivated reason to submit to quarantine and can be cost effectively identified and quarantined. Or B Quarantine 100 of people. Completely destroy livelihood of millions just to be sure those 2 are also quarantined.
