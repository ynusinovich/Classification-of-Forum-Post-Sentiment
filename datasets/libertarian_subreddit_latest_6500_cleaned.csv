The pandemic was going to harm the economy no matter what.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,certifus,t2_883if,I'm more red than blue on this issue. The question is why is Healthcare so expensive in the US. IMO it comes from corruption and red tape.

Which is why they are trying to enforce voter identity instead of just using names. You re literally arguing that the house was already on fire. That s literally blaming Trump for everyone that set the house aflame. Goodness. You honestly believe that those specific doctors knew every secret about medical science that nobody else in the world.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,GinchAnon,t2_nbgkfer,gt If people didn t prioritize freedoms over lives already which I think we should the speed limit would never be over 30 mph. There is a balance to be had. IIRC early on in the development of cars many thought a speed limit above like 15mph was psychotic because it was too dangerous. I think the question is where the line is as to what counts as essential liberty and how to reconcile the issue when maintaining that for some is in conflict with protecting that or an even more essential liberty for others. How direct indirect of infringement is acceptable or unacceptable For example would KNOWING you were infected and going to a social gathering of people who had a high chance of dying from it be acceptable or would that be too much and an actual infringement that is a problem Where is the line

I grew up in predominantly republican areas and I can say that those places were dirtier than where I live now that is predominantly democrat.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,dont-be-a-dildo,t2_12r0i5,Lol okay you are clearly not here in good faith. gt The south had many republican congressmen immediately after the civil war when they were supposedly racist Are you seriously saying that if there was a switch it would be immediate Because that is not what I said and is obviously a strawman you could argue against. This occurred over a period of time during the civil rights era. gt gt Or are you saying that the South went from overwhelmingly Democrat to overwhelmingly Republican during the civil rights era because its inhabitants just... switched political ideologies themselves By the way you conveniently ignored my question I would like an answer. Why did the South go from solidly Democrat to solidly Republican after the civil rights era gt By the honest media Yes by the honest media. There is a litany of primary sources including Republican strategist Lee Atwater himself gt gt You start out in 1954 by saying N n n By 1968 you can't say n that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now that you're talking about cutting taxes and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is that blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract and that coded that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me because obviously sitting around saying We want to cut this is much more abstract than even the busing thing and a hell of a lot more abstract than N n So any way you look at it race is coming on the backbone. The websites telling you this didn't happen are not honest media they are the PragerU grifters of the world. While I have you here you made this blatantly false statement earlier gt If they switched then why didn't the representatives switch Very few congressmen changed parties in the supposed switch. Representatives DID switch. Strom Thurmond opposed to the ruling of Brown vs Board of Education switched from being a Democrat to being a Republican in 1964 because of the Civil Rights Act. He called for other Southern Democrats to do the same believing they would be able to elect Goldwater with a southern coalition. Here's some more representatives that switched SC Rep. Arthur Ravenel Jr. SC Rep. Floyd Spence Texas Rep. Jack Cox Mississippi Sen. Stanford Morse Alabama Rep. Albert Goldthwaite Louisiana Rep. Roderick Miller South Carolina Sen.

He wasn t worried about paying for it by the way he was worried about missing work and having to live off soft foods for a while To quote a doctor interviewed here commonwealthfund.org gt So if you are in a hospital and you need surgery you don t wait. It gets done in if it needs to be done in 30 minutes it will be done in 30 minutes. If you need an MRI for care provided in a hospital you will get it whenever depending on where you are because not every hospital has an MRI but you will be prioritized and that will happen probably as quickly as it can be done anywhere. It is as the priority drops or is deemed less by whomever that the wait so the waits are how long will you wait to see a specialist after seeing your family doctor. gt I mean the one that people will talk about is cataracts hip surgeries non not cancer type surgeries where there things will get worse if you don t get treated And so you can wait months for those surgeries. gt Can I buy myself a spot closer to the front No. gt I t depends on who you ask how people feel about that and whether they are in the situation where they do have disposable income that they feel that they should be able to use towards their own speedier access to health care. Versus the general public belief that this is a right and if it s a right then why would we why should money trump need There is really no mechanism to buy a spot in the line. And now that doesn t mean it s just first come first served. There are priorities but those priorities for the most part are clinically based.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Libertarian4All,t2_628grczu,as a man who lives in a rural area on a big plot of land there is no real threat of a non airborne virus getting to me I haven't had the flu in 15 years Or in other words I'm unlikely to be affected in any way so I assume the media is lying about everything All of the businesses on our strip have voluntarily reduced hours to keep people safe and followed suggested guidelines There's some fear of being shutdown temporarily but we're far more concerned for our and our customers' health. Government overreach is definitely occurring and we need to keep a close watch but pretending the media is exaggerating when doctors are posting shit themselves about how desperate various hospitals are getting when the national guard is doing one of the few things government should do and attempt to set up field hospitals that's a fucking problem. Pastors shouldn't be arrested for keeping their churches open but they should be held accountable when their congregations inevitably catch the disease. Maybe the true libertarian solution there is for every person in that congregation who gets sick to sue the shit out of the megachurches for lying about the virus and endangering their congregations instead of taking the smart route and simply broadcasting a service without people. One person actually got pissed when I politely asked them to curve the line around the aisle in our small store and left all because they felt it was apparently too much work to walk 5 seconds and wait another 30 while standing a few extra feet apart. And at that point the line was heading in a direction it shouldn't normally go in our store regardless of the tape we put down to keep people spaced while waiting on the register. Too much bullshit from Fox and other fake news downplaying this shit like it's just the sniffles and only a few old folks already on deaths door will suffer is dangerous stupid and stupidly dangerous. The government is absolutely capitalizing on fear and infringing on rights they may not be inclined to give back but pretending this shit is just the media or the bullshit theories of this is just to hurt Trump is going to get people killed And if you're dead the government can't take away your freedom. Because you're fucking dead.

To control the spread of disease within their borders states have laws to enforce the use of isolation and quarantine. There's long standing precedent for the government to issue orders to mitigate the spread of disease within its borders Source sacbee.com storylink cpy gt The law is clear the government has broad power in a public health emergency to take the steps needed to stop the spread of a communicable disease. In 1905 the Supreme Court declared Upon the principle of self defense of paramount necessity a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members. There is no right to put the health of others in danger and to act in a way that risks the collapse of our health care system. gt This is not a new principle. A few years after the end of the Revolutionary War Philadelphia was isolated to control the spread of yellow fever. By the time the Constitution was drafted and approved quarantine was already a well established form of public health regulation. States as part of their police power were deemed to have the authority to order quarantines to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. In 1926 the Supreme Court wrote it is well settled that a state in the exercise of its police power may establish quarantines against human beings or animals or plants. gt The court emphatically stated But the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,gatechthrowaway1873,t2_4ogkdvaj,gt well documented By the honest media The south had many republican congressmen immediately after the civil war when they were supposedly racist They had Joseph Rainey in 1870. The South learned from their mistakes quickly. The democratic party did not.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,moak0,t2_bzyig,Like I said I've made my point. If you really want the last word go ahead.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Allout-mayhem,t2_3iyyvhqn,I like that he lowered the small business tax love the deregulation good foreign policy generally love the prison reform just to name a few. Don't like the increase in military spending I think he's a narcissist some broken promises hate the war in Syria. There are obviously many more things to consider but I think that his personality and obsessing over his every word is pretty stupid. If somebody thinks that he's all bad or all good they're hacks. He's done a small handful of libertarian minded things in regards to the economy but I think it's a stretch to consider him a true conservative.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,aetius476,t2_5shqb,It's way worse than the flu but you're right that it's not the bubonic plague pre antibiotics or smallpox in the new world pre vaccine. 70 fatality across an entire population is literally a civilization ending number that few diseases in history have ever achieved and have not once achieved since the advent of germ theory. I can't even think of a disease that would achieve that in the modern world. Ebola if it was airborne had a several month incubation period before symptoms and also somehow got in the water maybe

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,moak0,t2_bzyig,You're not explaining how the meaning is different but that's fine. I've made my point and belaboring it any further would be hypocritical.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Libertarian4All,t2_628grczu,I feel the same way about a lot of the right leaning libertarians on this sub. Like I'm not sure if these people genuinely believe themselves to be libertarian or they are just trying to muddy the waters and are doing grunt work for totalitarian politicians like McConnel and Trump who are actually in charge of a combined half the government.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HistoriaMagistra,t2_1axiyfev,I searched COVID 19 a week back and saw nothing of the sort asked. Specific issues regarding Trump response or underlying issues like authoritharian regime's responses universal basic income discussions... Nothing specifically unifying and asking about what a Libertarian approach to this crisis would look like. But sure i'll take your downvote.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,dont-be-a-dildo,t2_12r0i5,I said nothing about switching. The Southern Strategy is a well documented historical event.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Insanejub,t2_cnl33,Depends what form it is in. In political terms I would consider it bad. Under this context it s taking from one and given it to someone else simply because it is unfair to have inequality Why though There is a false pretense that any who have a lot has to have stolen it from someone else. At least with many progressive progressives in the US It s a false pretense and generalization which many tout as a dogmatic reality yet don t understand at any level other than surface what they are saying. For instance Bill Gates didn t become rich because he stole from millions of people around the globe. He became rich because he supplied a product that was insanely beneficial and provided an extremely valuable service which millions of people paid for voluntarily at an agreed upon amount. They weren t forced to buy this product They wanted it and used their own earned capital to pay for it. Now saying Bill Gates doesn t have a right to his own money which he has because he provided a product that has revolutionized the world in many respects is the round about practice of ignorance and greed thinly veiled as the right thing to do because it s unfair etc etc. The biggest factor without question in changing one s place in society is yourself. Placing blame on those who have succeed doesn t change that. Are there other factors Yes of course. But no other factor comes close. Blaming factors outside your control doesn t change your life. And demanding others provide for you or worse generalize all of those with wealth have put you in the position that you are in keeps people in the positions they are in. Why try to do better if factors outside ones control are what is truly keeping them down That is the one thing it does do. Provide an excuse to not do more or try harder in life. Everyone WILL never be equal at the end of the day. That s a reality of human existence. The Prado Distribution is a perfect example of this. The other aspect to this whole comment is how to model a society with respects to our very psychological tendencies. A society can t be formed with laws and legislation opposing basic human psychology instead it must take advantage of human tendency and develop something good from that. And that is exactly what capitalism does. People are motivated to help themselves. Capitalism allows people to earn more if they provide something that other people want though. It s a form of forced altruism in a sense. Taking the basic motivations of people and making something good of it. Bill Gates was likely or at least not initially motivated to help humanity but instead to earn money. So he made a product that helped others and became rich as a result. Redistributing wealth just because inequality is unfair is greed. People should get the fruits of their own labor. For example If they risk capital in a business and it is very successful they deserve the benefits of doing so not you and not me just that person. Stealing their money by voting to take it away based off the lie that it s empathetic is the thinly veiled excuse for envy and greed of the success of others. Make your life better by your own hands instead of trying to take from those who have already done so. That s why redistribution of wealth is inherently a bad thing Obvious exceptions are obvious
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,zonky85,t2_9vqsz,There's some fallacies here. To be clear the risk this paddler poses to public health seems pretty small. He's by himself. Presumably travelled there alone. Seems like he's more likely to get or transmit the virus in jail. I want to dissect this a little bit though. Let start with contagiousness. Covid transmits almost through pure proximity meaning many people may be easily infected. HIV requires more... direct contact. Most adults don't have sex with everyone they come within 6 ft of... This carries into the likelihood of you being unknowingly infected. That is your carrying HIV unknowingly is far less likely than your carrying SARS CoV 2 unknowingly. So there's that.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Jswarez,t2_14mi11,Wait. Who thinks politics ever is a merticoracy Did anyone Why do you think think Clinton played sax publically or bush drank been. Relatability. We want relatable people in charge in politics not the best.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LRonPaul2012,t2_6bjry,gt You can't make that claim that entire communities who are showing no symptoms by anyone are just lucky We're in the middle of cold season and allergy symptom. So lots of people are going to be having symptoms we just don't know whether or not those symptoms indicate coronavirus without testing.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,You re one of those people who hate trump so much it will destroy your opinion on anything obviously hypocritical. Let me help Cages started under Obama. Naturalization laws are an enumerated power. Providing ID to stop dead people from voting isn t voter suppression. This virus has done nothing compared to the millions of lives affected by shutting down everything and restricting people s ability to work and earn an income for themselves and their families. Trump implemented the travel ban while everyone gave him shit for it. Obama couldn t have prevented the coronavirus. 200 million dollars is not a cure for a virus. Secured 50 000 Annual presidential salary 400 000 He s donated every presidential paycheck to government programs. H1N1 reached 60M cases in the US. We still went to work school everyday. YES and Trump is advised by all heads of all the federal programs so I hope you understand how horrible the federal government is at spending other people s money. Healthcare should not be in the hands of our federal government and if you think that s the only federal federal program spending we need to cut you re still not paying attention.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Libertarian4All,t2_628grczu,YOU get to be a libertarian and YOU get to be a libertarian this FISH gets to be a libertarian... EVERYBODY GETS TO BE A LIBERTARIAN But no free cars. We don't have the budget for that

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,PrivilegeCheckmate,t2_bjitu,I assume a few people are testing the order with a deliberate intent to test the law sue to keep it in check. The law enforcement argument is that you can't endanger yourself in such a fashion that requires potential rescue. This actually raises an important uniquely American point your survivors can sue for failure to properly rescue yet you will also sue if they try to stop you. In Italy I'm pretty sure that if you want to swim and risk drowning shark attack go ahead but no one's rescuing you. Here liability can be argued for duty of care. Someone in another sub compared the government's failure to enforce social distancing now to the mayor in Jaws It's an interesting question.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LRonPaul2012,t2_6bjry,gt Or do you simply not give a shit about the 800. 000 dead kids that die from a disease that can be prevented in many or maybe even most cases Trump thinks that having 240 000 deaths in the US alone will be a sign of doing a great job. And that's with a lockdown in place and assuming that only 2 of the US population gets infected.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Realistic_Food,t2_1xmfy8l0,gt The complete lack of concern about what governments around the world are being allowed to do right now is concerning. It is to be expected.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,prussian-junker,t2_1q46c6wj,No it s just not. You just don t understand what rights are if you believe that. Rights are very limited in scope to be something inherent to you from birth by way of being born a human. Things like speech belief and property are rights. Rights don t involve the control of the actions of others we tend to call that state of being slavery and infact the reason slavery is wrong is because it s a violation of someone s rights. To declare the actions of someone else your right you are effectively making them slaves. This is why food shelter and healthcare are not rights.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,piouiy,t2_adbt6,You re putting words in my mouth. I didn t say any of the things you re arguing about.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,piouiy,t2_adbt6,Lots of metrics are more important. Freedom yes. Quality of life. Economics. Societal functioning. Convenience sometimes. We make those decisions every day.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,AlphaTangoFoxtrt,t2_10iuzzg1,If you only believe in rights when it's convenient you don't believe in rights. You believe they are privileges the government can take away whenever they wish. And that's more dangerous than typhoid and covid combined.

With a JoJo Supreme ticket Supreme would do the vice presidential debate against Pence and whoever Biden picks maybe Warren. His routine would work fine in a VP debate people don't take the VP very seriously anyway. If Biden picks someone more coherent than himself like Warren for VP who is known for proposing lots of serious plans Supreme's routine might be coherent in that context.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Boronthemoron,t2_lmon3,To be honest I probably don't know enough about food stamps to have an opinion on the pros and cons aside from my initial gut reaction to just give people cash. My understanding was that when you give people stamps you can inadvertently give some more than what they actually need and some less than what they need. So the two parties will want to come together and trade food stamps for money. Since this is illegal it creates a black market for these things. That's my probably very oversimplified understanding. If the stamps you're proposing are just vouchers for medical insurance rather than individual treatments I can see that working pretty well actually. gt I'm all about the market and I don't really like government paying for stuff but I don't see how we can win this since US healthcare has been so bad for so long. I'm trying to come up with the least bad bone I can throw. I agree with you here.

Trump has completely abandoned his duties as an actual president and left the 50 states fend for themselves and compete with one another for resources which is far more expensive and less effective. gt the insane stimulus package wasn t a result of his presidency We wouldn't need a stimulus of that size if he had been doing his job from the start and if he hadn't dismantled all of the agencies and failsafes that Obama set up specifically to prevent something like this from happening. gt He did make cuts to mandatory spending so bravo for that Yeah like shutting down the 200 million program designed to predict emerging viruses so they could be dealt with early on including hundreds of novel coronaviruses in cities like Wuhan in late summer of 2019. Gee you don't think that something like that might have come in handy do you What Trump did was literally worse than nothing. But hey he did manage to secure 50 000 in emergency spending so that he could go golfing this weekend at his own golf course using tax payer dollars so there's that. gt You can hate him all you want but it doesn t change the fact that he s the net positive out of all the candidates. Right now Trump's best case scenario is 240 000 deaths which is about 3x higher per capita than Italy. And that's his idea of doing a great job.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,lima_xray,t2_10gg9z,These hospitalization and mortality rates are of the tested population and not the population as a whole. Since there are shortages of testing supplies leading to rationing of who is tested there's a significant selection bias distorting the sample population. In other words we have no idea how many people actually have COVID 19. Given that these rates have been falling as more tests become available and the sample size grows and the massive variation between tested populations the actual hospitalization and mortality rates are probably wayyyyy lower than these quoted figures. Until we have a proper randomized sampling of the presence of SARS CoV 2 antibodies in population we have no idea what the actual mortality rates are and the rates you're quoting don't mean what you seem to think they mean.

What is the exact number What's the law and who determines it What constitutes deadly enough to wreck the world and remove freedom Obviously the flu wasn't deadly enough now or in 1918 to remove our freedom...so there's some number right There's some cutoff between acceptable viral outbreak mortality and unacceptable and apparently that number is a secret. What is the goal number of deaths What's the number that's going to make it legal to operate a business and go visit friends in America

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Mountain_Dragonfly8,t2_1uqzfc2h,Yeah I remember seeing a video last week ish of the spring breakers in Miami who weren't following social distancing orders. The cops proceed to aggressively take down two of the people tackling them both. One officer goes so far as to push one's head to the ground with his knee while the guy is being held down and not moving. I commented about how while I completely agreed that they should be home there was no reason for the officers to be as aggressive as they were. That was likely my most downvoted comment and everyone was making pointlessly aggressive comments about me and nothing to do about the actual comment I made. I understand that we are going through a rough scary time but that does not justify undue aggression and unfair treatment by police.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,qmx5000,t2_1edmncd2,He wants out of Afghanistan wants medical price transparency and hasn't increased payroll amp self employment tax which is good. However his idea of promoting manufacturing was increasing tariffs cutting corporate income taxes yelling at companies and encouraging the Fed to keep inflating the stock market which was bad. To encourage more investment in manufacturing you actually want to decrease credit creation and increase corporate income tax rate on non manufacturing firms engaged in real estate and asset speculation and reduce any excise and sales taxes on tangible inputs for manufacturers. I guess he's alright as long as he doesn't start a major war or pursue any obscenely anti labor economic policies like a national sales tax.

Trump is not presidential. That being said if 2016 happened all over again I d still vote for him. I hate saying the lesser of two evils because there is just bad choices but I don t see any libertarian option or any options that would actually work to preserve our posterity as a nation and decrease spending and fed powers outside of the enumerated powers incentivize localized governments to do their job in their communities and I don t see people taking their responsibilities as Americans seriously and letting them sit in office while doing nothing and electing them because they recognize the name or choose the party affiliation is just ignorant to their duties as an America. I want others to understand that complaining about the government without any willful action to make change is worse than complaining and making change in the direction that opposes my views.

I don't think the bioweapon allegations are well founded considering its lack of lethality but that is different from saying it's impossible for this to have been manipulated e.g typical gain of function studies which would mean it was in fact engineered though not purposefully introduced to the environment.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,I didn t sidestep you asking me to bring forth a post I directly pointed out that I never based my wording on them. If you read my reply you would also understand that I am certainly not bothered by my perception of libertarianism and whether others agree or not. I simply made my observation based on my perceptions as one can only do for themselves. I have no reason to convince anyone of anything. I merely performed the similar action to walking into a grocery store seeing a bunch of apples and saying those apples don t look good And then a bunch of other people in the grocery store started saying things about those apples and I don t know anything about apples requesting me to go find 25 apples that are good so they know exactly what apples I deem good and not good and saying really just a bunch of wild things that have made me laugh my ass off honestly because people are so caught up by anyone s opinion being any bit pervasive to their opinion. It s a fact that my observation fits my perception but just as that isn t basis for me to dictate that observation as fact across all people s perception of the apples doesn t make it any basis for anyone to believe my worldview on apples is decided because I simply stated an observation. Not understanding what someone means is better solved by inquiring. Simply asking what do you mean Is sufficient. Someone can make a post and it be a statement simply because they want to. Could be that I didn t want to say what I was thinking out loud so I just decided to post it on Reddit using anonymity like a thought bubble in my own head. Only difference is others can expand upon that can say what they want as well. Doesn t mean that the apple has to look good to me.

And if you're worried about major metropolitan areas... there are already sufficient fences and walls in those location.

A potentially infectious person Compared to the guys on a boat together He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of disobeying a lifeguard and violating Gov. Gavin Newsom's stay at home order a misdemeanor. He was booked at the sheriff's station in Calabasas before being released with a notice to appear in court deputies said. Officials did not release any identifying information on the man. He could face a 1 000 fine up to six months in jail or both. So far the state order has not been widely enforced by police agencies but this isn't the first time this week a Southern California man has faced consequences for being in the ocean.

My point was that for a math major that you claim to be you are making conclusions based on cherry picked statistics that have at best just a vague correlation which either shows your complete lack of understanding of statistics which should be a very worrying sign for someone who actually studies math or just that you are arguing on bad faith. You simply can't make the conclusion you are making based just on this poll.

If excuses were money I'd be broke and you'd be rich. And btw I grew up poor. In east Las Vegas off Spencer and Nellis. Not a great area. When I went to school Clark County had the lowest performing School District in the entire country. And yet somehow here I am making it. And you want to talk about how good I have it I worked for mine. You know why I'm doing well Because I'm not a lazy fuck. You already showed your hand on what your problem is. You refuse to get a job that you don't enjoy. Well that's not realistic. Good paying jobs were easy then everybody would be doing them. And then it wouldn't really be good pay if everyone was making it would it Stop making excuses stop being a lazy fuck and get a real fucking job. I have no sympathy for you. Fuck your situation.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,chodpaba,t2_4n546,gt Your rebuttal can only stand for what you agree disagree with Since you are a newb to this sub I can forgive that you are just not familiar with some of its truisms. Things that everyone who spends enough time here can clearly see. There are many like yourself who are certain of their own definitions of libertarianism etc. But you will find given enough time to make further observations that contributors to this sub do not in fact agree about what libertarian means what socialism is and those disagreements run the spectrum. So it is generally insufficient for the purpose of clarity to use these labels without discussing ad nauseum what you mean by them. This is further frustrated by the trolls the Poes and contributors who lack any sort of internal consistency. This is why I was asking for you to point to specific examples of what you consider to be an admitted minority of socialist posts. Which you chose to sidestep. Your definitions are not helpful because without any exemplars as fixed points it remains vague how you would apply your definitions to a specific example. This is not simply the case of post modernism everything is relative blah blah blah... It is simply the case that I do not know what you mean. Because my perception is that libertarians of all stripes are well represented in this sub and it is going to take some convincing to persuade me otherwise. There are plenty of differing views expressed in r libertarian and it is not very meaningful to me and not very important to even try to make a binary differentiation. So you are bothered by a perceived lack of libertarianism. Why is that important to you and why should I care... Make your case. But be prepared to bring the receipts.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Substantial_Parfait,t2_17ouvstx,America is relatively low on economic freedom and constantly keeps going down for other reasons than healthcare according to an American conservative ranking heritage.org version 65 Most of the countries that rank above the United States tend to have public or market heavily discounted healthcare systems. Among healthcare America ranks low as well numbeo.com The problem here is that Neoliberal policies have mostly extremely subsidized companies that should by all account have bankruptcy in their name. Considering there is no perfect free market objectively America should learn from countries with better economic freedom. As for my East Asian free market comment I still think they have in general great free markets however they tend to be relatively more authoritarian in social policies.

Speech coveys messages and my words being fancy or not is not some attempt to flourish an IQ level rather an attempt to ensure my point can t possibly be misconstrued. When you get criticized for every single word you speak by many others resulting in long discussions going back and forth you tend to make specific wording so that your points require less explanation. In some cases it may require more words and if those words happen to require you to look them up in order to understand them so be it.

That s pretty fucking flimsy. gt they are socialism is different from marxism and communism This is actually true but not in the way you intended. Marxism is more of a general philosophical framework not a full on political ideology agenda economic system the same way socialism is. And communism is a hypothetical future stateless moneyless state of affairs that s supposed to come about after socialism has run its course. We often use the word communism to refer to what countries like the USSR and China and Cuba do or did because they were run by the Communist Party of XYZ but not because they achieved a stateless and moneyless society run by and for workers because they didn t.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,The laws are contextual is doesn t translate to totalitarian. Having freedoms restricted because of lack of law is not indicative that my spectrum is flawed. Like I said in an earlier reply tribalistic virtues within said landing laws on the political spectrum are not automatically moving that government to the left or right. It s not a matter of 0 laws are anarchy and infinite are communism. It s a matter of law of mankind s manner of living and with anarchy there simply aren t any. No decrees no constitution no charters nothing. It doesn t mean the people are free as there is also no security to ensure their freedoms. People that would abuse anarchist states and become overlords without any decree over life and how it should be conducted would still leave that as an anarchist state. People that somehow develop real self conscious humans through simulation and have godlike control over their every accessibility life and have a written line of code for every manner they live in and use that code to have everyone live peacefully and in harmony without war or suffering would still be a totalitarian state of government. The range spectrum doesn t change based on number of laws but rather the dictation over humans lives involved in those laws. So if right from anarchy one law is made and it s a law deciding ever decision to be made every day until the end of time it s instantaneously jumped to the opposite end of the spectrum. Inversely if the decree of lines of code have one line of code that takes away any coders ability to make any dictation over anyone s life in regard to any manner any human can live in ever then they ve jumped to the other end of the political spectrum. The spectrum is simply a measure of decreed control over mankind s living. The tribalism that falls within that decree or lack there of doesn t move its place on the spectrum rather it s place on a spectrum of morality good and evil That spectrum and the political spectrum have worked in tandem since humanities existence.

My suspicion is that there are probably a few percentage points difference than last year but COVID 19 is probably not 1 of all infectious diseases. My speculation is that there's a lot of confirmation bias and people only paying attention to disease deaths because of the media hysteria.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Publix_Deli,t2_s70ki,gt Of course but the alternative is do nothing and get 30 million deaths. Because that is what would happen if you don't have ventilators hospital beds and when everyone gets a very high load of the virus. The math here doesn't check out. First of all the infection fatality rate is not as high as the numbers imply because the untested infected people vastly outnumber the confirmed cases. This virus kills 0. 1 to 1 of the people who get it not 10 Secondly the ventilators aren't saving many lives anyway. Over 80 of C 19 patients that are put on a ventilator end up dying. The overwhelming majority of patients who don't require a ventilator will survive with nothing but OTC and mild prescription drugs. If hospitals closed their doors on C 19 patients tomorrow and started sending them home with Tylenol albuterol and pedialyte then the fatality rate would only increase by a fraction of what it is right now.

Ya that does make us better. Thanks for agreeing with me. Canada has free speech you are free to show me conclusive evidence that contradicts that. And hate speech isn t free speech.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Insanejub,t2_cnl33,They shouldn t be. We already have safety net after safety net in place to help those in need who but cannot readily afford care. I don t understand this view. I ve worked in a dozen different hospitals clinics in Bay Area including some of the poorest areas of Oakland and this is not as much of an issue as it is made out to be. A campaign of misinfo will do that though unfortunately. If you go ANY ER today and cannot afford treatment or just refuse to pay you don t. That is already a pseudo socialist form of medicine we have in place. Also most doctors will help patients address concerns with payments and provide them with workarounds or outright not charge for services to lessen a financial burden. Many doctors too will just NOT charge patients for procedures and supplies to lessen the burden or outright eliminate the financial burden on patients. The reason a bandaid costs 20 at the ER is a direct result of middle man government REQUIRED management. More government is NOT the answer to a government induced problem. In 1960 s Medicare installment with disproportionate money given to physicians into 1980 s Medicare revisement forcing early release from hospitals and insurance companies helping with legislation that ultimately hurts provider care to the ACA further increasing costs of insurance premiums and burdens on private providers to keep costs lower for patients It s a complex situation but single payer government healthcare insurance is most certainly not the answer.

Hitler had a vested interest in appropriating the word socialism for himself because legit socialism was popular back then. That was the reason for the branding. gt lol you just fucking described almost every nation of the time esp the ones that ended up fighting the nazis have you ever picked up a history book I don t give a shit if that s what all countries were like back then I hate those qualities all the same. And I think it s safe to say that Nazi Germany took all of those qualities to their limits If you understand the socialist movement in general and the reasons for it even existing you understand why Nazism and fascism generally is a reaction to it and against it not a version of it.

While there are fewer suicides that's more than offset by the reduction in fatal traffic accidents. It does say that suicides during the GFC did increase by 5 The suicide rate in the US is less than 50000 per year. Projections of the death toll from coronavirus if nothing is done to prevent its spread range from 1 million to 3 million. That's higher than any realistic estimate of increased suicide rates.

You havent addressed anything at all Ive brought up. gt Explain how the government would protect someone civil right against a virus spread by selfish idiots What if the selfish idiots in your analogy is the government who has too much power and is putting citizens' lives at risk What then What about The FDA Continues to Actively Undermine America s Response mises.org From the beginning of this battle the FDA has slowed American medical companies' ability to respond at full capacity. For example it was FDA regulations that significantly slowed the creation of testing kits in the early days of the crisis. While the CDC s government labs were creating fatally flawed COVID 19 tests private labs were desperately trying to receive waivers to ramp up their own efforts. On Feburary 24 the US Association of Public Health Laboratories made desperate appeals to get into the game. Although the FDA tweaked its rule five days later to allow labs to begin testing kits though it still barred their active use without approval it wasn t until March 16 that the FDA finally removed its grasp on the private sector and allowed labs get approval through state agencies. More crickets from the left... How is a government that cant manage a virus suppose to manage national health of 300 million Americans You didnt bring national health care yadayada part of intellectual exchange is other side brings up points you have to address its part of not being a narcissist where you actually address the points people bring up instead of shutting down in soft fragile defensive shell...

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mattyoclock,t2_bvajy,that's a truly awful metric because again it's binary. You can tell if someone supports universal health care or the war on drugs. Up and downvotes give no indication whatsoever as to whether the users responding would like to go further and have the government assume the means of production. IE Not everyone who wants background checks for gun purchases wants guns to be illegal. Over 70 of gun owners want background checks and gun owners tend to want guns to be legal. All you know is that on a binary scale they want to be more that way then we currently are. also your spectrum is not reflected in the government or political parties of this nation or to my knowledge any other nation in history. contextual law used as determination of others lives is the factor used for the spectrum and no law at all would be on the far right and absolute law on every matter of life the far left that is just completely unsupported by history. Conservative governments tend to have more laws not less. Would you argue that Saudi Arabia is a leftist progressive state See a lot of freedom there Do you find it significantly more free with less laws than France Is Turkey more free than Germany And i'm really not trying to shit on conservatism here there are plenty of more left countries where the freedom is lacking as well like venezuela. My point is that your spectrum absolutely fails to map to the real world. When reality conflicts with your beliefs throw out your beliefs and find new ones that reflect the real world.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Substantial_Parfait,t2_17ouvstx,I mostly view the government as extremely inefficient at solving issues at hand. Maybe other countries governments are simply more intelligent or practical but the U.S government seems backwards on a world stage. All the civilized first world countries tend to either have extremely regulated healthcare or public healthcare but in my opinion a country like Singapore is closer to my ideal among first world countries where they have a strong free market yet offers a public option healthcare plan. In my opinion lots of East Asian countries tend to have the best balance between free markets and government programs.

Problem with that is 1 we are at least a month away from mass testing 2 people will freak out about the government using data even though they are apparently fine with amazon Apple google using it for god knows what and 3 there is a huge group of the population that can t afford testing much less treatment so they will be hesitant to go to the doctor. And also people are morons. Like way too many of them.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,blewpah,t2_8ae4o,gt Yes they go out in the water. One here or there. And the ones that do are arrested and removed. Or they get themselves into a dangerous situation and either drown or someone has to go and save them itself putting the rescuer s at risk. gt I'm just picturing you as a lifeguard screaming at a lone person in the water that he needs to get out NOW and stop ignoring him because while you are dealing with him there might be someone in that empty water in danger of drowning. That's an extrenely possible scenario. I'm confident that kind of situation has happened many many times. gt I don't have a problem with lifeguards having the ability to get someone arrested. I'm just of the opinion that using the idea that someone might be in danger as a way to back up the use of the rule in this particular situation seems irrational and authoritative. I didn't say anything about this particular situation I'm defending the need for lifeguards to have authority as a whole.

It is racist genocidal nationalistic traditionalist imperialist warlike pseudoscientific et cetera et cetera and you can count me out no matter what words you apply to it. That s what matters. this isn't about what you want its about germany being socialist gt racist genocidal nationalistic traditionalist imperialist warlike pseudoscientific lol you just fucking described almost every nation of the time esp the ones that ended up fighting the nazis have you ever picked up a history book tell me how where race relations in 1930's USA or how many wars the british empire fought in the early 1900's or how nationalistic france was... here you go straight from the horses mouth gt Socialism is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists. Socialism is an ancient Aryan Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism unlike Marxism does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism it involves no negation of personality and unlike Marxism it is patriotic. We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our socialism is national. We demand the fulfilment of the just claims of the productive classes by the state on the basis of race solidarity. To us state and race are one

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,No I meant what I stated. To better comprehend what I ve stated as it exists read through the comments and observe the pro socialist anti socialist remarks and their respective up downvotes. Stating that the rojava government is left wing is ignorant to the spectrum itself. If your understanding is that self governing doctrines are to the left of the spectrum then the middle has to be as close to anarchism as you can get and slightly right is anarchic chaos. Wildly to the left is totalitarian dictatorship of law but that s a skewed spectrum as is. It s not hard to understand that contextual law used as determination of others lives is the factor used for the spectrum and no law at all would be on the far right and absolute law on every matter of life the far left. In this respect a self governing law of protecting others but allowing them to express and live as humans rather freely would fall in the middle. To suggest that they are left wing is to suggest a different spectrum that doesn t align with a conceptual grasp of what the spectrum represents and rather a narrative that the spectrum is supposed to represent. In my observational statement it s important to note that I didn t claim it was over a six year period. I simply made that statement after observing what I ve observed on recent occasions. Using the remarks and their respective voting as evidence this post itself is filled with more socialists than libertarians.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Terr_,t2_3wkmu,gt Like I said wonderful imagination. You should become a writer. The fact that you've confused me with an entirely different poster should function as a wake up call.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Insanejub,t2_cnl33,It s literally called r libertarian lol. Anarcho capitalism isn t libertarians.... that s anarcho capitalism. The definitions of words are not fluid bud. We are a libertarian sub which has a strong stance free speech. Unfortunately this is Reddit and many progressives not all some here for honest discussion can t help it when differing opinions exist so they try and change the course of discussion in places where that is the case. Libertarian is libertarian and it still is. It is not conservative or socialist or progressive or alt right or anything else. And the basic tenants of Libertarians is 1 less government not more 2 value personal freedom of speech without gov curtailment 3 right to do what you want without the interference of the government as long as it doesn t hurt someone else 4 economic capitalism consensual exchange right to own private property etc These are the fucking basics for libertarianism. If you want a lot more government that ain t libertarian socialism. That s progressive or socialism or welfare capitalist. This ain t hard stuff people. Edit I actually like the fact that people from every different ideology come but you don t need to lie about what you consider to be your political meanings to make a persuasive argument. You also don t need to try and redefine libertarianism to meet whatever current political figure you re trying to get libertarians to vote for as libertarian. Their actions can speak for themselves.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,The history of this post is all the evidence you need to comprehend the observational statement I ve made.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,fonduefoundation,t2_5gkolzug,That makes sense. Maybe I shouldn't say smarter maybe I should say more cognitively developed. My dad grew up poor and paid for his own college and got rich. I grew up rich and ternd out to be extremely loveable and stuped as shit Here is more anicdotal evadince google.com 3famp Wouldn't it be true that even still the rich would have a higher density of successful word I replaced for smart given your IQ thing I know privlage and stuff also people because people like that tend to move up socal economic wise and nonsuccessful people weather poor or rich move down. Aka rich gets poor's winers and poor gets rich's lossers. Even tho avarage people might stay in same bracket the rich would have a higher number of more successful people. Also regardless of how it got that way it might make sense to save people with the most developed brains. But like again I'd be happy to argue for why we should have free health care as that's what I believe and then people would stop making me feel like a horrible person for offering dissenting views and down voting me on a thread where the guys looking for reason in support of privatized health

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,The only thing that you can speak to is what you agree with or disagree with which itself is not objective. Your rebuttal can only stand for what you agree disagree with meaning your statements are subjective on their own as well. It doesn t constitute any criticism for my statement as my statement doesn t constitute any factuality to itself. There is no absolute truth in anything making every argument baseless in its entirety and basing any argument in the negative of any pro position of a baseless argument is also irrational. The best you could do is notice what messages are conveyed most prominently and what gives those conveyed messages the most direct avenue to their meaning. The best way currently to do that is communication through language and etymology of words and their meanings have worldwide interpretations and understandings when they are used. Socialists and libertarians are most widely utilized as conveyers of messages of which socialists support socialism and is recognized most prominently with Marxist realization of communism and libertarians support liberty of individuals and freedom of being held responsibly to their own choices. If a matter of discrepancy between those messages conveyed are what you seem to have your eye on in this discussion then perhaps you ve strayed too far from the understanding of the messages conveyed most popularly around the world into a rather ambiguous distinction between absolutes and the subjectivity that follows the lack there of. That is not a reason to make an observational statement that was claimed as a fact to be to be representative of my worldview. If it is not fact by its virtual impossibility to be proven true but is also not wrong by its virtual impossibility to be proven false then I ll correct myself to call it an observational statement as I originally did. Regardless it isn t wrong.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,dog_snack,t2_zql0t,Capitalist countries have nationalized industries public education pensions and whatnot as well. Social democracy is when you have a capitalist economy safety nets. Again fascists will implement just about any mishmash of policies to gain support. And once again rich industrialists loved them and actual socialists hated them Norway has those programs and nationalized industry but whenever people like me say we could stand to be more like Norway we re met with well that s ackshually a capitalist country Yeah I know They re still demonstrably on a better track and they got where they are after decades of worker activism and left wing governance. gt also yeah they exuded people thatr was the platform it was national socialism socialism for germans 1 it s excluded and 2 well yeah it was ultranationalistic which leftists tend to be against. Socialism is supposed to be internationalist a worker in Germany has more in common with a worker in Uganda than either one does with the ruling class of their respective countries.

Virology immunology cell biology and multiple omics are used to compare the differences between humans and other mammals. Then just over a month later on Dec. 24 the lab posted another job opening this time noting long term research on the pathogenic biology of bats carrying important viruses has confirmed the origin of bats of major new human and livestock infectious diseases such as SARS and SADS and a large number of new bat and rodent new viruses have been discovered and identified.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mc2222,t2_5nnka,then perhaps this data is more relevant the case hospitalization rate statista.com again one of the main objectives of trying to curb the pandemic is to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed like we've seen elsewhere. Edit gt 150m people will not develop pneumonia no i didn't say 150m people would develop pneumonia i meant 150 would get covid 19 i can see why this may have been confusing i wasn't explicit of those 150M 10 would need hospitalization citation in the link

Not 2 of anyone who catches it. gt On the basis of a case definition requiring a diagnosis of pneumonia the currently reported case fatality rate is approximately 2 So that upper bound is way too high. 150m people will not develop pneumonia. Data is heavily skewed towards those in hospital and dying as noted by many health professionals. So I don't for a second think it will be 10 of 150 million people in the hospital. America will soon have 1 million tested positive some believe we will soon see there will NOT be 100 000 hospitalizations.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mc2222,t2_5nnka,you don't do risk analysis based on the lower bound estimates and then conclude there's nothing to worry about. you take the upper bounds determine how bad it can get and then ask if that's worth it Here let's run through some of the math i'll clearly state my estimates as we go There are 360 M people in the US let's round this down to 350M to make the math easier pandemics typically self limit once 50 60 of the population have been infected. so let's round this down to 50 to make things easier so 150M people will become infected. Of those infections let's assume examine two boundaries of the mortality rate 2 0. 1 this means the true number of deaths will like somewhere between 3M 150K. this is a pretty wide range and the upper part of that range is what we should be looking at to see what the impact could be in terms of worst case. Consider also that another major component of this pandemic beyond the fatality rate the case hospitalization rate. This is going to be a pain to calculate given this data statista.com so let's just say 10 of infections require hospitalizations or about 15M people. This last point is key the hospitalization rates are problematically high. not to mention the economic impact of everything listed above happening in just a few weeks what's more we've already observed that the hospitalization rate is capable of overwhelming the medical system Italy NY so to some extent the mortality rate is a bit of a red herring the problem is the healthcare system.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Substantial_Parfait,t2_17ouvstx,Here s the thing I disagree with Medicare for All or Free healthcare but at least it s consistent on its intended goals so I can logically disagree with it and have an honest discussion with ACA and supporters of the ACA I just wonder if they are secretly crony capitalists or corporatists because quite frankly the government may tax individuals an unreasonable amount but it should never ever promote individuals to purchase private businesses services. That s why in my opinion I have more in common with Progressives than I do with Neoliberals. Half assed solutions go nowhere
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,randall-politics,t2_3n858bat,I don't think it will a infect every single man woman and child at once.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,nosoupforyou,t2_e386,Yes they go out in the water. One here or there. And the ones that do are arrested and removed. So it seems like there really isn't an issue with lifeguard's needing to worry about others possibly being in danger not unless there are suddenly a group of people determined to go swimming at the same time even while the lifeguard s yell at them to get out of the water. Honestly are you really serious I'm just picturing you as a lifeguard screaming at a lone person in the water that he needs to get out NOW and stop ignoring him because while you are dealing with him there might be someone in that empty water in danger of drowning. I don't have a problem with lifeguards having the ability to get someone arrested. I'm just of the opinion that using the idea that someone might be in danger as a way to back up the use of the rule in this particular situation seems irrational and authoritative.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,kingofthe2hole,t2_knmc9,gt That's a pretty standard level of requirement in the law. If insider trading laws can obtain a subpoena for records with no evidence of wrong doing then that is a massive violation of due process. The unusual trading pattern itself is the requirement for them to investigate. They then subpoena communications and records related to the trading. If I have someone who makes a trade selling 100 000 shares of a company before the company announced financial hardships and their shares dropped significantly they'll investigate whether it was coincidental timing or if they were trading based on MNPI. That is not a low standard or violation of due process it's a recognition of unusual activity which leads to an investigation. Then they must prove the person was acting based on MNPI.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HectorHuntsNazis,t2_5zgz72cb,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA Do you really think that people pay attention to your stupid comic book alex jones conspiracy wannabe fake libertarian bullshit We're talking about the real world here not your fake ass stupid wannabe libertarian bullshit chatrooms. Nobody gives a FUCK if you call them a statist or a sheep or any of that stupid shit. Its so fucking silly. You may as well be wearing a clown suit when you say silly shit like that. YOU are another perfect example of why there will NEVER be a libertarian party govt in the US. Because you of your illogical irrational anb just plain stupid nonsense.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,marks1995,t2_b9opj,You are still under some assumption that we need lifeguards and they are somehow obligated to protect us. That's my issue here.If the beach is closed send them home. They are not law enforcement. I have and do swim all the time at beaches and lakes with no lifeguards. I'm a grown ass adult and don't need you to save me. I know when I go in the ocean I could drown.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,bodhitreefrog,t2_1wv4pov3,This happened where I live and I'd like to give you all some context. We have been in self isolation quarantine 17 days now. Even last week we had people still attending beaches. To combat this problem the police have closed down parking lots of beaches. Since beaches are currently closed the state is trying to actively keep people indoors except for doctor's appointments or grocery store runs. This is not terrifying and the point is to keep people from returning to the beaches. If one guy is surfing then ten people will join then ten families will join etc. It's not about attacking one man's rights it's about keeping the very stupid people from returning to areas in gatherings. And we have many stupid people in California This is only for another month or so and so far we are handling outbreaks far better than NY. I am glad Governor Newsom ordered a state wide quarantine as fast as he did it was much smarter than Florida that just did it 2 days ago Much less people will die in California and we are thankful for this. This is temporary for a pandemic. This is not a permanent way of life. Here's a chart you can see all the states that are effectively isolating versus the ones that aren't even trying. gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jess_albas_twin,t2_131xqp,so its not in a name might want to learn what the nazi party stood for genius gt Abdicating and returning their wealth that was stolen from British and colonial taxpayers. gt Public Execution you are a moron
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,InattentiveCup,t2_i5kh3ik,Never said I disagreed with all your points. Just the consequences of a full libertarian society. The Constitution is pretty cool tho might read it later idk.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DomoArigatoMrPoPo,t2_5ypiij3k,gt Wanting oversight on the chief executive so he doesn t abuse power seems extremely libertarian More regulations are not libertarian. gt Or do you support the version of libertarianism that somehow prefers autocratic dictators I support as little regulations as humanly possible.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jess_albas_twin,t2_131xqp,gt they just instituted rule by decree and suspended all elections giving with no sunset clause by they you mean a massive majority of publicly elected parliamentarians gt so you just regularly shill for fash or what lol are you retarded
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Takashishifu,t2_38y0hy5z,gt Yeah. Well I mean that just that proves that you need something beside market force to force compliance with the demand of the people. I mean if the government was not there then you really would not have much of a choice you either have it or you do not. You can complain all you want but without the government most people will just pay the extra amount. You're forgetting one thing. You can't charge just anything you want unless you have a monopoly. Anything that makes a lot of money will have many competitors sprout up. Just look at Apple when they released the iPhone you got Android. The government enforces a monopoly on insulin letting only a single company produce it. Kind of more of an example of governmental failure to set correct policy honestly.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,blueteamk087,t2_x37oi,And the OP wonders why the Libertarian Party is an absolute joke of a political party.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DomoArigatoMrPoPo,t2_5ypiij3k,So you're brigading. Gotcha.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,JJinPDX,t2_r6yba,In this day and age Was it ever ok

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,blueteamk087,t2_x37oi,It's more than a 0. 1 fatality rate. In the US it's currently 1. 6 most likely will end around 1 at the best case. Also government response to a pandemic doesn't wreck the economy the pandemics wreck the economy. Also governments can recover an economy they can't bring back your loved ones back from the dead. And no it's not just elderly people dying now. Young people are dying as well some of then are seemingly in great health.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DomoArigatoMrPoPo,t2_5ypiij3k,Bud you are in the WRONG sub if you don't want the government taking your rights away. This sub masquerades as libertarian but is filled with people who think more regulations is libertarian and capitalism is Authoritarian. I can link you if you want This sub routinely tries to violate others rights by use of government all while claiming they're libertarian. It's absurd.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,PoopMobile9000,t2_3ynprgy8,Wanting oversight on the chief executive so he doesn t abuse power seems extremely libertarian. Or do you support the version of libertarianism that somehow prefers autocratic dictators
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,graveybrains,t2_3w1k9,Aww now your making up new stuff That s cheatin
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Takashishifu,t2_38y0hy5z,gt Comcast cannot charge that much because of the fear of the U.S government. If they charge that much then the people will complain and then the government state or federal would step in and make them stop. I'm saying this claim is false. Comcast charges what they charge because that's the price the market will bare not because fear of the US. Government Do you really think that's how they decide pricing There's a reason why Comcast and AT amp T lowered pricing in areas where Google Fiber came out. Higher prices mean more margin for competitors to succeed. Jeff Bezos once said your margin is my opportunity
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jadwy916,t2_8ojaw,Not that weird. I never claimed to be a Libertarian. I'm an American.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Jabrosif0714,t2_2i1cb15u,That s because we let them talk without banning them or sending them into comment throttle. They crawl out of their safe spaces like the maga refugees sometimes do to try out their arguments. I think most libertarians have long left the sub. It s more of a free speech sub now.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HectorHuntsNazis,t2_5zgz72cb,So you support NOT trying to minimize exposure to a virus that has already proven itself incredibly deadly and contagious. YOU support allowing people to contract and transmit the virus allowing it to possibly become a wild fire doing far more damage to the economy and the population than a shut down would. Stop lying spreading misinformation and propaganda.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mc2222,t2_5nnka,and my counter is out with the old and in with the new

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,degeneracypromoter,t2_4zykzdpa,yes the monarch wields supreme executive power at the end of the day. Parliament I think the Royal Family should be given the choice of 1 Abdicating and returning their wealth that was stolen from British and colonial taxpayers. 2 Public Execution.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,snowbirdnerd,t2_13mtu0,My point is that what people think is good for Libertarianism and what actually is good for it are two very different things.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jess_albas_twin,t2_131xqp,yeah demanding the nationalization of industries welfare for old people mothers absolute state education for free ect aren't socialist at all
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LiberTTTT,t2_56kzmuny,How about this Since we disagree you live the way you want to live and I live the way I want to live. If we can other agree to not force our views on each other there is o point in argument. So how about it Are you willing to leave me alone
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jhgroton,t2_4dulri9s,There s no way the party will run AOC if Sanders couldn t even get himself nominated. The GOP is at a crossroads. They can continue the culture war but concede their economic platform which is what the neo Nazis like Bannon and Richard Spencer want they ve seen right wing populist parties do shockingly well in Europe by running to the left of the conservative and center left parties on welfare They would have to find someone here that isn t so outwardly racist but isn t too capitalist either. Even Tucker Carlson who openly supports Warren and Sanders ideals and has criticized capitalism is too outwardly white nationalist Or they can do a post Trump mea culpa tour and start nominating Bill Weld types and support immigration reform which is something Bush Jr recognized as important but the rising anti immigration wing torpedoed back in 2004. Charlie Baker would be their man here but he s just too white and nerdy. I d be a lot more willing to vote GOP if they go the latter route but I m afraid that would only embolden red flag law supporters gun grabbers and neocons.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Chrisc46,t2_ycno6,gt You're defending renting human beings as chattel property.... Wrong. I'm defending your right to voluntarily sell your labor to a willing buyer. You do not have the right to control humans only to purchase their voluntarily traded labor. You already asked about indentured servitude or voluntary slavery. This is an impossible contradiction that doesn't fit within libertarianism. Labor can only be purchased while voluntary since it otherwise cannot be enforced without violence. We've had a long enough conversation for you to understand this.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,calm_down_meow,t2_13k23wo6,You're making a broad general conclusion based solely on an extreme rare event. Even in a more socialist continent like Europe their internet privacy laws are stronger than the US indicating some libertarian values are still highly valued in democratic socialism and remain a bedrock of modern democracy.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Havetologintovote,t2_5o29y07s,gt For most people it's no more inconvenient than a cold or a flu. For a small percentage it's a death sentence. This is profoundly ignorant shit. You either haven't been paying attention or are too stupid to understand what you're seeing. Not that I'm surprised to see either one. Amusing to see an ardent believer in natural rights accuse anyone else of being a religious zealot by the way. You are the very definition of a religious zealot but absolutely hate it when people point that out
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,PoopMobile9000,t2_3ynprgy8,0. 1 of the US population is 328 000 people. That would be a little below American deaths from WWII.

Fatality rate is almost entirely dependent on response it s not the disease that kills it s the disease combined with an over stressed medical system.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jverity,t2_39r9o,That's the point it's not you endangering yourself you put the person required to rescue you from your stupidity in danger. You put the other people you may be headed towards in danger and even if that's not the case they are now in danger because the person who is supposed to keep them safe is busy with you. We live in a society and there is almost nothing you can do that doesn't affect the people around you. Don't like it Buy enough land so you never have to see anyone and live off of it like Bear Grylls decided to be a hermit. But you don't get the benefits of society and at the same time just get to do whatever the fuck you want. That's not how it works. And I don't live in California either.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mc2222,t2_5nnka,gt That happens every flu season and every cold season. Should all production be shut down to protect production from a bad flu this is both more contagious and more lethal than the flu. It's also infectious for much much longer than the flu before showing symptoms. think of this less like the flu and more like a bad viral pneumonia. You're also overlooking the fact that the seasonal flu doesn't overwhelm the healthcare system. This does. gt A business is not the economy. One isn't sure. but this won't be limited to one business. When businesses struggle people will loose their jobs. gt None of what you write has been refuted or addressed. gt a relatively mild disease like COVID 19 is going to fuck the economy. i appreciate you trying to downplay the impact of this pandemic but it will over run the healthcare system if left unchecked. How's Italy doing how's New York doing in the midst of this mild disease
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,EZReedit,t2_7fqz4nz,That s them bringing charges. If I say I want a trial the government has to do something for it. Edit I don t really care anymore at all. If you want to think that the right to a trial is a negative right then go ahead.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,rchive,t2_y9jp1,Every system is imaginary until someone makes it for the first time.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DomoArigatoMrPoPo,t2_5ypiij3k,Yes and no. Libertarians don't like the federal government more than state governments but let's not pretend that state governments are good. In fact they're usually worse than federal governments. But the libertarian approach to drugs is to not care what people do and not regulate them. It's also a libertarian position to not pay for some retard burnouts medical bills when he ODs and fries his brain at 25.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,JacobMartin74,t2_15czox1r,I disagree completely. I am not saying that the past is a utopia that we need to go back to. I am lifting up aspects of the past as an example that we can learn from. The founders of America did have a more libertarian perspective on politics. Remove the problematic elements that didn t allow all people to enjoy those freedoms and you have a good idea of a direction that we should strive for. It is only in this hyper politically correct world that we can t see the good of the past though it s flaws. I refuse to participate with that and so does anyone who truly wants to learn from the past to make this world a better place.

They said since she was young 29 and didn't have any comorbidities they weren't going to test her. They diagnosed her with an unknown viral infection and prescribed her an Albuterol inhaler. So whatever the death rate numbers are they're definitely exaggerated. They only test people that are more likely to die. Which is fine from the standpoint of limited resource management.

But growing up low in socioeconomic status deprives you of many of those opportunities which lowers your potential for intellectual development. The reason for the headline having a racial angle is that nonwhite people are on average lower in socioeconomic status and thus receive less opportunities for intellectual enrichment. As well as regular enrichment

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mattyoclock,t2_bvajy,So first no. You mean it has more progressives than libertarians. There are very very few actual socialists in America or on Reddit. And almost none of the posters consider themselves socialist. What they believe and argue for is not socialism. Sure it s closer to socialism than our current government is but that kind of binary thinking and reduction is exactly what leads us to a two party system. You could just as factually claim we are closer to nazis than their beliefs if the scale is socialist vs nazi. But that s a stupid scale. Second this subreddit in the about six years I ve posted here has been markedly more right wing than the actual libertarian party is. It seems like this is switching as the virus takes hold and as we get closer to the election. But that s not surprising at all as more people get politically engaged during those times and we know that first most of America is left wing and within Reddit s demographics it s overwhelmingly so. More people will mean more left wing. I d invite you to consider though that the current most successful libertarian government rojava which functions on municipal libertarianism is very much left wing and clearly shows that left libertarianism is both real and functional.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,blacktongue,t2_5fk4j,I don't follow your first point. Yes there are non profits but they clearly can't provide all healthcare that people can't afford. If it were profitable to provide services for people who need them but can't pay for them someone would be doing that. I really don't believe that the only thing blocking universal healthcare is government regulation. I'm not saying these problems are dependent on a monopoly. I'm saying if you have a private monopoly running healthcare for the country or a government run universal healthcare system they're effectively the same. Both benefit from economies of scale and let's just say they're both run well so they're efficient as hell. They're virtually identical except when it comes to accountability. The govt running their program is accountable to the elected representatives and institutional checks in balance all backed by the votes of a finite number of individuals. The monopoly isn't accountable to anybody it may be in it's best interest to act in any one way but if the numbers don't show it and they control the market there's nothing their subjects can do. In poor patient example say they employ all the doctors that do an expensive procedure. A business person can offer a doctor more to work for them and then provide this procedure to the poor or a student can learn to be that doctor to serve only the poor but the fact remains that the service costs money that they will not recoup.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,asdfa1234nknln,t2_4wcpb6dm,Yeah. Well I mean that just that proves that you need something beside market force to force compliance with the demand of the people. I mean if the government was not there then you really would not have much of a choice you either have it or you do not. You can complain all you want but without the government most people will just pay the extra amount. With regards to you saying the federal government allows people to charge hundreds for insulin I have not seen any evidence of price regulation in the insulin. I have seen proposals about regulating it. In fact you can see here that this is a perfect example of an inelastic good or service. In this article statnews.com you can see that the price of insulin went from 175 gt 1500 in fifteen years. If this was something that was elastic then you would not see this price increase without a drop in demand. However in the article it mentions the companies are seeing increase in profit due to the increase in price hinting that there is no a decrease in demand. So you can see that these companies could possibly push this up to 2000 or 3000 and probably still see the same number of people buying it.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,InattentiveCup,t2_i5kh3ik,There's a difference between a laissez faire economic policy and what has been proposed by every libertarian I have spoken to irl. According to the ideology these people follow the government should only exist to enforce property rights and settle law suits nothing else. If a company wants to engage in unethical activity such as indentured servitude or bare minimum wages or even economic colonialism the east india company they should be allowed to. If the people want these companies to stop they will voice their opposition with their dollar. If the government if run following the doctrine of Libertarianism and given no power besides those two things than companies can act however they wish and the most profitable and successful will be able to dictate how a economy and society operates. If anything the government serves as a road block for these companies.

Hopefully we learn a lesson and stock up on things for the next pandemic the last time we had one like this was over 100 years ago after all I think it could be done if we tried and if not we could at least be doing way better than we are now. The thing about the American system in particular and I heard this from a nurse working at a hospital in Oakland is that because there s no universal insurance there s an assumption that some people won t be able to afford the care they need. Which is pretty fucked up when you think about it. We were unprepared up here in Canada too they re building a makeshift ICU outside Toronto as we speak but we at least try to treat everyone regardless of income and live with the expectation that we ll get the care we need as urgently as we need it. I hear all the time about how afraid Americans are to go to the doctor even if they re really sick or injured for financial reasons. It saddens and angers me quite honestly.

If you don t believe in rights then where exactly are you drawing from as the source of this entitlement other than your mechanical exchange of oxygen to carbon dioxide and the productive value of others labor Even if you do believe in rights the question still stands as to why you deserve for free what others must toil to produce. They are the ones absorbing all the risk if they fail and you are getting all the benefits if they succeed. Nobody should be willing to suffer that kind of system unless they don t fully grasp just how big of a fence post they re having railed up their backside. You seem to take issue with the concept of corporations but they re honestly just people. Every business in existence is a collection of people producing a good or service in exchange for some perceived higher value by its customers. This creates added value because both parties agree that they are coming out better after than the exchange than they were before it otherwise they would keep what they started with and the business would go belly up from a lack of value creation which is why 70 of all new businesses fail in the first 5 years of existence check the BLS if you don t believe me

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Jason_OT,t2_61ci8,You are so laughably full of shit. gt 1 No one knew rightc0ast was any sort of alt right until he was gone I have been here since 2007 and had many discussions and PM's with him and had no idea. The only person that all us mods from other libertarian subs he asked to help out in the emergency he was dealing with thought were working with was the second longest running mod of libertarian we all had known for a decade. He started r Physical Removal. He started r TheNewRight. There were numerous calls for him to step down or be demodded explicitly because he was pushing the altright movement even before Trump was elected. He made all of that very clear long before you and u JobDestroyer stepped up to be his lackies. He'd been doing it for literally years before you two dipshits decided to don the brown shirts for him. gt We are all VERY anti right in our personal views and we take an extremely hard line against alt right in goldandblack. The whole reason goldandblack was created was to get away from those types. Meanwhile you personally are pro tariff pro Trump and both of you continue to defend your actions in rightc0ast's attempted conversion of r libertarian to an altright sub. You continue to defend volunteering to be mouthpieces for a self described fascist. It's been what almost a year and half now And still neither of you has come up with an honest response to anything.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LiberTTTT,t2_56kzmuny,Corporations like we have now don't exist without government. It's just a title that gives legal immunity to individuals. In a free market individuals are held accountable to the law. When the CEO of a corporation makes decisions now they can rarely be sued themselves or even held criminally liable. The federal reserve and all its phonies shell corporations would fail if competition was allowed. That's why they outlaw it. Another good example would be companies like BP would just go bankrupt and some people would likely be punished when they spill oil everywhere. People would actually have to answer for those crimes.

This year I ve waltzed into clinics in three different provinces to get prescriptions renewed refilled with no hassle. When my doctors booked me for a heart ultrasound or a neurological exam they just booked me with whichever specialist had an opening. Every time I ve had to go to the ER like 6 or 7 times in my life I just went to whichever one was closest. When you get yourself a family doctor you just sign up with whichever one is accepting new patients and if it turns out they suck you can cut ties. Anything medically necessary is covered from stitches on my finger to second degree burns on my foot to an appendectomy all of which I ve had to colon cancer removal which a cab driver of mine had a few months ago don t ask why he brought it up he had been diagnosed the day before and needed to vent I guess I can t be kicked off or denied coverage because it s my right as a citizen and taxpayer.

If your renter loses a month in wages where do you think they are going to find it in the following month Demanding an extra month of rent from people without income makes about as much sense as demanding a month of salary when your employer has no clients and you've had no work to perform.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,chodpaba,t2_4n546,There isn't any accounting of who the membership is or who is voting. The only thing that anyone could really go by is the content of posts and comments. So a statement like representative of the supposed libertarian membership doesn't really mean much. For one thing there is marked disagreement about what libertarian' and socialist' even mean some even consider that the two do not even represent any kind of polar axis that there is considerable overlap as evidenced by conversations in this sub. What's more voting does not even necessarily indicate agreement disagreement but may be used to highlight higher quality threads over lower quality threads. And this may be done by lurkers who don't even have a dog in the fight. 300k members is scarcely a blip compared to Reddit readership as a whole. There may be only a fraction of that looking at the page at any one time but given the sheer ratio of r libertarian subscribers to the vast ocean of Reddit users it is likely that even within that number only a small percentage are actual subscribers.

You haven't yet said anything to convince me that Trump had any reasonable response possible that would have prevented those 100 000 Americans from dying.

Think of all the lives lost in Iraq Yemen Afghanistan and the drug war here. This is all the action of government killing people and ruining lives for profit. Most of the evil shit corporations do is given legal cover by government. And let's bot forget all the politicians getting rich in every crisis.

This isn't the Measles which spreads to something like 13 people for everyone infected this has an R0 of about 2. 5. That's only slightly higher than a normal flu. If we can get that close to 1 then the spread isn't exponential anymore. If we can limit the rate to 1 and everyone that gets it gives it to 1 person then medical staff can handle the load. gt until this is over Until what is over We aren't going to eliminate covid 19 we can only hope to reduce the spread to a reasonable rate until enough people either get it or get vaccinated.

Value human lives over money. Capitalism makes you do evil things. 2 You missed the point. Yes it should be up to individuals to do what they feel is necessary to protect themselves but you're telling them what to do by saying that they should be open. You're not letting them decide you're telling them what's best for them just like you're saying that the state SHOULDN'T do. 3 Missed the point again. The State didn't close my employer's business. In fact my state is doing almost nothing to combat the spread of the virus and our number of cases and deaths are increasing exponentially. My employers are remaining open despite the threat of illness or death just to make money. THEY not the state took away my choice I HAVE to come to work or be fired. If the state intervened I'd be safe at home either getting paid still or collecting unemployment. 4 Look in the mirror at what I'm calm I'm just talking.

All the animals value their species above others it's natural.p gt I do NOT think that human DNA is an essential characteristic of personhood I do think that the essential characteristic' is an organism's innate mental ability to recognize the concept of rights and respect them. This makes personhood open to any intellect that can conceive and understand this concept of rights. Think of intelligent beings from outer space human constructed machine intelligence or even different species on our own planet that may have this ability but haven't derived the concept. gt Dependemcy doesn t take our rights away eg. disabled injured people infants gt I agree. Rights' are dependent on one's fundamental nature not one's circumstances. gt gt My post didn't propose any timeline It suggested using the same criteria for legal purposes that are accepted for the end of life. gt gt No birth beginning of life gt I appreciate the thoughtfulness of your post but this is an unsupported assertion. And I disagree that birth' is the point of personhood Birth is a change in cirumstance not a change in the fundamental nature of the organism which I believe is necessary to go from non person fetus' to real person' gt gt Every legal regime must define what humans are subject to it and the first step in that process is to determine what properly constitutes a being deserving of rights' i.e A human being. gt gt I agree. I want it to be conception or at least not in the 2nd or 3rd trimester. Roe v Wade cannot cancel human rights and it could be wrong. I cannot imagine a much worse advocacy than to fight right to life with some right to privacy. The Yeah I agree. Roe v Wade effectively legalized abortion but did nothing regarding personhood There is no existing legal definition that does that I know of. This is definitely an issue that needs to be dealt with by Congress.

People need to take a little personal responsibility for their health if you don t want to get corona don t go out touch people and then touch your face. Everyone could do that on their own with no government intervention at all and in fact i d argue it should be their right to choose. The government intervention seems to make liberals more comfortable because the game theory outcome of voluntary quarantine is that lots of people still go out and spread the virus forcing everyone to conform to the highest risk tolerance. Voluntary education campaigns can help with that but I certainly have no problem with people killing themselves if they choose that. Not to mention it s all well and good if we stay shut down for a month maybe 2 if it goes on for 6 months the economy will shrink too much to accommodate the service job folks still having no jobs. Eventually there will come a point where someone has to consider exchanging lives in favor of the economy or more people are going to die from the economic fallout than the disease.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Bunnyhat,t2_7ziqy,You know there are states that have been doing exclusive vote by mail for quite a while now Washington state for example has been doing it since 1983. Oregon has been doing it since 1993. There have also been lots of studies done by universities groups and companies in the process. Do you know what they found That by and large vote by mail is largely secure with few cases of voter fraud. In fact for Oregon only one case of voter fraud has been found. It was done by a Republican who said she was just trying to counter all the fraud the Democrats do. There are many mechanisms used to ensure that only the person who is supposed to be voting votes. Including things like being able to track your individual ballot to see if it arrived or if someone stole it. Also matching signatures on both the ballot envelope and voter registration. And you can always show up to an actual polling place and cast a ballot that supersedes the ballot that was mailed in. To any sort of voter fraud to effect even a small local election you would have to commit hundreds of individual actions by first stealing ballots from hundreds of peoples mailboxes make sure no one notices them missing figure out what their signature looks like and then make sure they don't request a new ballot or vote in public. All while making sure you aren't caught a single time because every one of those actions are a felony. You would have to do that ten's of thousands of times to impact a state wide election. And with mail in ballots if there is an accusation of the count being wrong we can simply do a recount of the actual ballots using eyeballs instead of machines. In person voting done by machines are the much more vulnerable position for fraud that can actually impact an election.

I'm saying that in this hypothetical someone picks up coronavirus at the movie theater and then later goes to the grocery store because like everyone else they need to eat and infects other people. In this hypothetical I made up the chain would not have started had they not gone to the movie theater. I get the sense that you think if it's possible to get corona at the grocery store then you will end up getting it which is far from the case odds are that if you infect someone with coronavirus at a grocery store they would not have gotten it if not for you. gt You are primarily putting yourself at risk not others. You're only marginally increasing risk of others as they're still exposed to dozens or hundreds of other people. Yes but you are still putting others at risk and by getting infected due to your carelessness you can easily infect many other people. Let me put it more bluntly if you get coronavirus it's not all that unlikely that you will pass it on to someone else which will kill them. gt You're establishing here that the virus can be spread at the grocery store which means the chain could just as easily have started there instead of the theater. The chain could have only started at the grocery store instead of the movies if someone else with coronavirus was at the grocery store and gave coronavirus to the same people the person at the movie theater person would have. The odds of that are essentially zero realistically if you give people coronavirus they wouldn't have gotten coronavirus if it wasn't for you. gt You only adding risk to people who have already accepted the risk of being in public. You can't put people at risk who are being responsible and staying home. That's everyone tho. Virtually no one can both avoid going out in public for weeks if not months and also not interact with anyone who's been out in public. People need to go out in public it's completely unrealistic to expect people to stay home for weeks or months.

My passenger thought it was a great idea and I thought that that level of dependence would be dangerous. I think this outbreak vindicates me.

What is Kushner doing that's so dumb other than outsourcing to friends in industry That's been the playbook for Clintons Bushs and Trumps alike Obama being a relative breath of fresh air that failed to linger for decades.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Mist_Rising,t2_jsslo,At the end of the day its what that nations society wants. Right now countries with pandemics are all seizing supplies in their country UK seized irelands France seized UK US seized goods sold to the French and so on. Since its global there isn't a surplus avaliable in 1 part that can be bought up by the needed area instead nations are scrambling. China isnt helping with its crummy failed mask giveaways either.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Raunchy_Potato,t2_4rfhr,This post wasn't criticizing how many supporters of a mixed economy there are on this subreddit. It was criticizing how many socialists there are on this subreddit. Which led you to write a long rant filled with caps lock and socialist rhetoric about how not muh REAL socialism So what do you think that says about you hm Remember this post was calling out socialists. So why did you get so uppity about it It's like someone made a post calling out how many Nazis are on this subreddit and you get all angry and start ranting about how it's not real Nazism. That would be a pretty good indicator that you're a Nazi no
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Mango1666,t2_10ikacn,gt You're arguments Come on. If you're gonna call me retarded at least cover the basics first. You would refute my argument to make you look at least a little informed. But calling me a retard achieves nothing but making you look like you can't come back from whatever I said. But hey free market of ideas so you do you buddy.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,grassinmorning,t2_37aw6cfr,Fucking commie
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,keep-it-light,t2_3rrpbbqr,The government s public school history books are warped and sanitized as requested by the financial successors to brutal institutions to leave out anything that might allow a person to connect the dots between old injustice and new. E.g most of us learned about the civil war and antebellum and then skipped forward 50 years to Jim Crow. Willful omission of the convict leasing and proliferation of trivial crimes that happened in between is why the notion that black man criminal is still pervasive 100 years later. Another example of public education being an abject failure waste of money and in this case a propaganda machine.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Twerck,t2_6zg4s,I'm not a paragon I'm just not a fucking idiot. You're sitting there wasting oxygen and outright claiming this will spread disease as if you're somehow the only intelligent person to have possibly conceived such a notion and that there won't be safeguards in place. You've clearly never been too poor to eat. Yeah I guess we should just let them starve. You know what happens when you get a lot of jobless starving desperate people
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jme365,t2_5h7yb3sd,You do realize that we have scientists studying this right now. That sure sounds like a truism. A stupid truism at that. In February our scientists You mean CHINESE scientists said that so far no infectious virus has been recovered from captured air samples. Is that supposed to mean anything given how tiny a virus particle is and how much air you'd have to filter and the unlikehood of finding an inactivated virus particle This would need to occur to demonstrate the virus was airborne. I think not. Based upon pattern and likelihood of tranmission scientists could conclude that the virus was airborne
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,EZReedit,t2_7fqz4nz,Lol the government can t just not try you if you want a trial just like the government couldn t not treat you if you wanted treatment. If you invoke your right to a trial with no charges there s nothing to try. You would just be standing in front of judge with nothing. Edit if you walk into a hospital and demand to be treated and then they ask what s wrong and you say nothing I m healthy they would just send you home.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,BriefingScree,t2_147g3w,If people want to refuse treatment that is their perogative. If they try and pass around infectious diseases then it may be justified to detain them.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,dcjogger,t2_5eqllmpq,Libertarians think fighting for freedom is hopeless because Americans hate liberty but only 3 of Americans fought the British during the American Revolution. Americans started supporting the patriots when the fighting became serious though. If you hate freedom what will you do when the Gestapo shoots your father in the head North Korea and Cuba show that people can be patient for a long time and endure tyranny but the fighting will be bloody when the war starts. Just look what happened during the Spanish Civil War.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,FrenchLlamas,t2_5ko8sd21,You know how you tell who the people who have no idea what a mixed economy means They make posts about how much socialist scum is on this subreddit.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Sean951,t2_a8vb9,People are considering it but I think most consider this to be reasonable expansion of state power. They get leery at the DoJ indefinitely detaining people without a trial not giving a guy a ticket for breaking shelter in place orders or whatever we're calling the quarantine now.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,kryptopeg,t2_12rnom,I think I agree with the arguments about doing sports like this putting you at risk of taking up a hospital bed. It's not just about isolation it's about avoiding anything that could put pressure on the medical system. I think the resolution in this case was stupid though. The paddleboarder should've just gone home when first spottes or the police should've just confiscated his board for the duration and sent him home with some stern advice being charged is silly.

Is a lack of broadband competition a thing of the past Yeah I didn't think so. gt But tell me once again how its all government regulation. I didn't say all Certainly bad ISP's exist Comcast anyone but the fact remains those companies get to be shitty because they face no real competition. If they know you have nowhere to go really what incentive do they have to treat you like a person Meanwhile Amazon customer service is some of the best customer service I've ever experienced.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,altforwhatnot,t2_1862wmeq,Look no president has had to handle a virus like this in a hundred years and Trump is right when he says nobody really saw this coming. But his forsight throughout this whole thing has been absolutely fucking terrible. He tweeted the virus was a liberal hoax 4 days before he declared a national state of emergency. And he said he thought we would be back to normal in time for easter 2 days before the federal government extended social distancing guidelines to April 30th. Its like he isnt even looking 1 week ahead. And in situations like these forsight has to be one of the top qualities you want in a leader. Where the fuck IS the preparation
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,valmeister,t2_5g403,Except they can just not bring charges. If they don't bring charges you don't have to have a trial. There is that option. Why doesn't the goverment have the option to just not treat you like they can just not try you Assume you are fine as they assume you are innocent
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,grassinmorning,t2_37aw6cfr,So the worst industrial disaster in American history is 146 deaths. How many died by the government pushing Indians west 146 ain t shit and it was by a fire not gas chambers.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,iopq,t2_6dowm,That's the problem. There are not enough tests to know if you have it or just not symptomatic. If you had enough tests to give to every person it would be over in two weeks. In fact that's how South Korea mostly eliminated it
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,EZReedit,t2_7fqz4nz,Lol doesn t answer my question and demands I answer your question. No they can t if you come to a hospital they have to treat you. If you ask for a trial they have to try you. If the police let you go then you could ask for a trial but there s nothing to try.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,3720-To-One,t2_3yvv5m5h,Hey I can move goal posts too. But here s a few examples that come to mind fire departments before public fire departments private firefighting turned into a massive racket where private fire fighting companies would end up extorting people for fire protection and if you didn t pay up your property suddenly had a propensity to magically catch fire and burn down. EPA before environmental regulations rivers would become so polluted that they would catch fire. national defense. Yeah private industry isn t going to be able to do that. criminal courts again something that private industry can t do
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Havetologintovote,t2_5o29y07s,gt which is why the virus is almost exclusively passed by contaminated surfaces. This is absolutely false. cdc.gov Quit talking out your ass man
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,RobTheTurtle,t2_wqxgx,Things that don't necessarily have to be affected will be when it comes to emergency situations. It is what it is. We just have to deal for a little while. Your situation is not the same as the story here. This guy is at one of the most popular beaches in Los Angeles. When word gets around that closures aren't being enforced then the beaches will quickly be packed again.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,TheHornyHobbit,t2_ifjgw,That s my point though. Viruses are not transmitted easily outdoors when your not touching things or other people. This is all massive government overreach. I understand closing bars and restaurants but they ve gone too far.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,AltForControversy,t2_1x9wd318,For now. Average American only has about a months' emergency fund. Millions with service jobs live paycheck to paycheck and are now out of work. I'd bet some American is spending the last dollar they have every minute all around the country. They'll stay chill for a while until they run out of food or can't pay rent. Then what I'm expecting things like muggings and robberies to go back up and they'll be more violent than usual because people will be home most of the time.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ItsJustATux,t2_2rtcz1ly,No. That s incorrect. The Root was founded in 2008. It wasn t purchased by Gawker til 2015. The Root s style has been consistent despite the change in ownership. Why Because their style is based on a niche of African American papers popular in the early 20th century.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Treshnell,t2_4aqf8,That's not really the point though. We're not talking about running it's an analogy. If you open it up to one person you have to open it to all people or devote the manpower necessary to tightly regulate the number of people If they let this one dude out to go surfing all the people that want to go surfing will go. And all the kayakers. And all the people that want to fish. And sit on the beach. It's closed for a reason.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,grassinmorning,t2_37aw6cfr,Haha that s all you got Once again history shows you thousands of years of history the government will take advantage of its people and punish them if they don t follow their set of rules. This can not be said for corporations. Give me another dumbass government good company bad question.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,valmeister,t2_5g403,But if they do not give you a trial they let you go. Bam. No one has to do anything. So going to answer my question on healthcare Can the goverment send you home and say sleep off that broken spine
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Dr---Spagetti,t2_3apw6sv0,We can give thousands of examples of corporations doing good and what they intend.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,GreatNegotiator,t2_110kcb,This is false. One of the biggest reasons mail in ballots are opposed is because they have a very high risk of voter fraud. It s not secure and the reason why some countries have stopped it and most have put up strict requirements. Yet the vast majority of ideas proposed don t even have basic security measures. To go further two other measures are being proposed by the Democratic Party now. Internet voting and ballot harvesting. That is the trifecta of voting fraud. Nothing has been added or said that would add enough protections. If all were to pass the US would have one of the least secure voting systems in the western world. This all comes at a time when the biggest election issue has been voting fraud and protecting the integrity of elections. Furthermore we have had voting fraud in the two recent primaries against Bernie Sanders. No one who is serious about election security would ever support these three measures without massive election protections. I get it why you support it. Your team wins.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,rendrag099,t2_xopc4,gt Does higher spending mean less availability for the general populace Not necessarily. Higher spending just means more of their earnings went to a particular area and doesn't really explain by itself whether that was affordable or not. High frequency of low cost items vs low frequency of high cost items can show a misleading amount total dollars spent and potentially give the wrong impression. gt Does less access due to increased burden of costs encourage putting health issues off and that may lead to even higher costs later on This is quite possible but that alone is not reason enough to invite government involvement. In fact before government was so heavily involved in healthcare in America it was very inexpensive and quite accessible freenation.org
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HighOnKalanchoe,t2_32qwzci2,Let's not pretend that this arresting people for buying N95 mask in bulk and capitalizing out of their own property is not an authoritarian overreach when that motherfucker in one of the first federal task force press conference right next to the president said to those that are hoarding supplies we gonna find you and we going to take them from you that was the moment when they showed what they're really about. Throughout all this emergency they have used the constitution to wipe their ass with it. The sooner we come to grasp with that and stop worshipping this pieces of shit politicians whatever the color they represent the sooner we take control of our lives.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,NeverGiveUpMan,t2_h6ec9,I like what you said I would just push back a bit on price gouging as in setting a price vs. setting a low bid price. One has an intent to take a panic and set a floor price whereas the other is completely set by what people will pay. There is no real influence. The people who want to pay the most will outbid until they are satisfied and it will cascade down. On the other hand price gougers create a monopoly and then set an artificial price not allowing market forces to readjust.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,TheWackyIraqi,t2_1tj7yqqn,TIL we have private healthcare in the United States. Fuck you're more retarded than I thought. Go vote Bernie retard.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,I see nothing wrong with that.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,TheGoldStandard35,t2_5772acmu,This is a super unpopular opinion and I hate using that term but I don t think driving drunk is that big of a deal IF you understand you are drunk and compensate with extra focus and slower speeds. It s the people who speed while drunk and act reckless who are a danger.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,NeverGiveUpMan,t2_h6ec9,n95 masks are literally a meme for Covid19. Anyone who sells them at all to people who want protection are just profiting off of stupidity just like anything else sold and bought by people out of emotion instead of comprehension. They're fuckin masks out of home depot for woodworking and painting. Have you ever thought how stupid it sounds that you think a home depot mask will protect anyone from a bioweapon YOU ARE KILLING OUR DOCTORS IF DONT GIVE AWAY YOUR PAINTING MASK. WE ARE DEALING WITH A BIOWEAPON GIVE AWAY YOUR LOWES HOME DEPOT WOODWORKING MASKS FOR THEIR PROTECTION. lol The main concern is nurses going into Covid19 confirmed isolation wards where patients are in medically induced comas and intubated. Wearing an N95 mask isnt going to do shit. China started cremating people alive yes that's real when confirmed Covid19. Honestly it is probably much better for the country then putting all our medical personnel in there with N95 masks and infecting EVERYONE at the hospital when they are asymptomatic. The bigger concern is making sure people like the Chinese national lady with a white American husband who posted on Chinese social media that she was so proud buying all the masks before the Americans could get any... she bought entire stores out... to make sure people like her are hung in the middle of town. But you're following the PRC. You aren't letting the Americans who prepared and may have a few extra masks get an economic boost. Nope you're going after everyone. It's a huge mistake. And yes if I were President I would ban N95 masks from all hospital personnel. I would not send Corona patients to hospitals. I would have hazmat groups at every hospital. We have done jack shit and honestly it's too late. All this mass protesting of price inflation is doing is costing some people who prepared opportunities. When everything falls apart the masks will be worth more than gold.. even n95 that doesnt work. Why PEOPLE ARE DUMB. And remember jemyr good people will remember how you idiots whined and complained.. and when there is no government t help you no eBay to report to no twitter or reddit to vent your frustration and you need food shelter or protection good people who would normally look out for you won't I know I am no longer planning on it seeing how you are idiots are mentally destructing. You're on your own more than you know. That mask someone sold may have been the extra food they would then go and buy your friend or a stranger would have given you when you were starving or in trouble. But now it won't happen. We'll just continue to export all our masks and no one will benefit here at home. And when you have nothing and people don't want to help you because people like you always stand out in the real world remember your attitude.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,Not libertarians but individuals in this thread. Throwing away any chance of convincing anyone they re a libertarian because they disregard libertarian policy in nature to side with socialists. They do it in the name of hating trump but it is not attributable to libertarian beliefs by any measure.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,SeeYouWednesday,t2_47uan7bq,gt You dont have an argument here. Ignoring a valid argument and claiming an argument isn't present are two different things sweetheart. gt Pretending that the virus isnt deadly and that you dont understand how its spread doesnt help your lack of argment here. I said nothing to indicate either of those things. It's clear your own ignorance and arrogance are blinding you to this discussion. You only disagree because you are dumb Very mature. gt Not caring that Americans can and will die The issue that you are claiming control over these people's bodies. It's their body. It's their choice to take risks if they so chose. gt Stop spreading misinformation propaganda lies. Perhaps during the lockdown you can work on your reading comprehension skills. Have a nice quarantine. Stay safe. Stay home.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,FrenchLlamas,t2_5ko8sd21,Oh I mean genius in the sense that it's so hilariously bad. It's almost like a parody of hardline libertarians.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,EZReedit,t2_7fqz4nz,You know if you get a fine you can ask to be tried and they have to give it to you People waive their right to a trial all the time but it s still a right. You can choose not to have a trial but the government can t deny you a right to a trial.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,Socialism but I have recently come to understand how socialists will ignore any criticism to their views.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,OnceWasInfinite,t2_on9nk,Since libertarian ideology started out as a left wing idea seems totally appropriate. I'm imagining you included a right in front of where you put libertarian so that your post makes sense.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ItsJustATux,t2_2rtcz1ly,Maybe if we actually taught history we wouldn t have been shocked by 2016. So many white liberals I know are shocked that our country has become so racist. I can t help but laugh though I do feel bad for them. The Obama years were an aberration. Racism and violence is a return to the norm for this country and black man without a gun is a fool.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,TheRedTomahawk,t2_1f2j3se,I don't disagree with you.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ArgentStone,t2_1w9ldsy1,If you don't fine him though it sends the message to everyone else that it is alright to go back out to the beaches and the water. The only reason this particular person had all of that open water is because others are obeying. Malibu is not some out of the way place. He got to have his fun making a playground of a usually crowded place by taking advantage of the social distancing imposed. That shouldn't excuse him from consequences.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HectorHuntsNazis,t2_5zgz72cb,You are the same asshole that claimed blind people should have the right to drive because there is nothing in thye Bill of Rights from the 1700's that says they cant.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,TheGoldStandard35,t2_5772acmu,Yes that s fine but who cares if someone uses the wealth they earned by merit to help others
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,talkincrap,t2_4dflhkvn,Believe what you want doesn't matter to me. Numbers don't lie. Seems like you have poor mathematical competence or you'd realize the percentages by population have such a large divide that by current metrics two months wouldn't make a difference in that let alone two weeks. 1 in every 340 people have been infected in Spain 1 in every 520 in Italy and 1 in 1 165 in the U.S Worldwide 1 in 19 infected have died Spain is 1 in 11 Italy is 1 in 8 and the U.S is 1 in 39. Also since you obviously failed genetics and world history you do realize that 75 of Americans are of European descent don't you So mean if you really want to remove the other 25 from population and infected counts yet keep 100 of the death count we'd be at 1 in 824 infected and 1 in 29 deaths.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,TheHornyHobbit,t2_ifjgw,Are you touching people or coughing on people when you run Running even in normal times is not where diseases are passed.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,FullmetalGameMaster,t2_12o0d2ij,Or we could the sensible thing and just legalize all drugs and hit the cartels in their pocket books. No let's instead pump more money into a war we've already lost.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,FrenchLlamas,t2_5ko8sd21,WAAAAAAAA EVERYTHING I DON'T LIKE IS SOCIALIST FUCKING TANKIE OK COMMIE IF SOCIALISM WAS SO GREAT WHY DON'T YOU LIVE THERE Hey why don't we consider the benefits of a mixed eco SHUT THE FUCK UP FILTHY COMMIE THAT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL Well if you look here it is perfectly legal and constitutional. THE CONSTITUTION IS A FALSE DOCUMENT ONLY TO GIVE THE GOVERNMENT POWER Socialism is a word that gets thrown around whenever people don't like something. It's become meaningless at this point. A free market capitalist country with a strong welfare system like the country I live in is despite what many people think not socialist. I hardly think people are mass advocating for socialism. Perhaps some more extremists sure. But they are a very small minority.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,SeeYouWednesday,t2_47uan7bq,gt Yes but the chain wouldn't have existed if you didn't get infected at the movies in the first place. The chain will just start at the grocery store instead. gt And if you go the the movies and the grocery store instead of just the grocery store you're putting everyone who just goes to grocery store at risk. You are primarily putting yourself at risk not others. You're only marginally increasing risk of others as they're still exposed to dozens or hundreds of other people. You're establishing here that the virus can be spread at the grocery store which means the chain could just as easily have started there instead of the theater. gt Sure and other people should be required not not unduly cause risk to others since many people have to take risks. But those same people taking risks are adding risk to you. It's a two way street. That's what I'm saying. You only adding risk to people who have already accepted the risk of being in public. You can't put people at risk who are being responsible and staying home.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Jaysavage0217,t2_378t2lgn,Good.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HectorHuntsNazis,t2_5zgz72cb,YES. Of course. Before we give a person control of thousands of pounds of metal that can kill people and cause a lot of damage we need to know that they they have the training to handle it.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Daktush,t2_d39js,gt Something that kills 75 of people would just kill everyone quick and die out without much damage. Depends on incubation period and ifectiveness Covid has an r0 of 2. 4 each infected person transmits it to an average of 2. 4 but there's stuff with r0s of like 9 even assuming all dead patients didn't have time to transmit it that stuff could survive a 90 death rate. I mean when the Spaniards shook hands with the native americans like 90 of the continent died
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Processtour,t2_avz4b,In the five states where I have lived when I have applied for a driver s license I had to provide the driver s license from the prior state my passport or birth certificate social security card proof of residency like a mortgage or lease agreement plus a utility or credit card bill. At the same time that I apply for a driver s license they ask me if I would like to register to vote. I say yes. They use all that same proof of ID to establish my voter registration. My identification information and signature is on file. When I vote based on various states they ask for my driver s license or state id and my signature which they compare to what is on file. There is absolutely no need for an extra voter ID because I already provided the required identification to prove I am a US citizen when I registered to vote. I don t need to prove it to some volunteer retiree at the polling station every time I vote I already did this. Getting an additional voter ID is just redundancy and makes it harder for people like my parents who don t drive to go the the DMV where you register to vote and get to get said voter ID card It makes it harder when DMV are strategically closed in democratic neighborhoods. Voter suppression attacks again They are just adding unnecessary layers to prove that you are a US citizen when you already did it in the first place. Follow the damn paper trail. All that shit is on file in the age of technology it s right there. Voter suppression at its finest.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,OnceWasInfinite,t2_on9nk,The only thing you mention that could be conceived of as socialist is the national healthcare system..... Implemented by Bismarck in 1883. Among the first in the world. While some efforts were made to prevent over utilization in the 80s the government continues to pay 77 of all costs to this day.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ASlingshot123,t2_57n6p3gd,You are an uneducated Trump supporter spewing bullshit taken straight out of your ass. The equivalent of a crackhead talking to himself on the side street only you're not a crack head you're just a deranged Trump sheep. No one needs to prove anything to you.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,grassinmorning,t2_37aw6cfr,Sure you can quit buying and supporting a private industry though. No side effect. Quit paying taxes and the government will show you a real fuck over.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,randall-politics,t2_3n858bat,Yeah that is what is dumb not trusting assertions based on almost no evidence. But what is very very smart is shutting down the global economy. No unintended disasters could occur from that I'm sure. Oh 10 million already out of a job 6. 6 unemployment claims I'm sure this will be great. Let's do another 2 months as recommended by Bill Gates and see how that goes.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,srname123,t2_5bfu3pie,When they take the wealth from licensing it is directly spent towards keeping the licensing program going. Nobody who issues car licenses is making a business out of it it s just money being spent on he community. Nobody from the government has any incentive to get that money. So why would they have a reason to take your wealth from you except in the context of bettering public safety
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LongLiveTheHaters,t2_2v2czqme,I found that more than 12 had libertarian titles and title s additional text being the post I don t care to read through all so let s make my intellectual standing on the matter to be in the worst position and suggest all 25 are libertarian posts in my belief. Contrary to the 300k members the upvotes of those 25 posts aren t representative of the supposed libertarian membership of the 1k members online currently my comments against socialism all have downvotes. It s not presumptuous to suggest that the majority of members who were libertarian aren t very active like myself therefore shouldn t be included in the assessment and the active ones have outweighed any anti socialist votes with pro socialist votes. Thus concluding that this sub has more socialists than libertarians. Edit changed titles to titles and info in title s additional text.

I'm not against listening to this woman's advice but as far as I am aware she knows just about as much on the topic as I do
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,dcjogger,t2_5eqllmpq,Wow. The problems of today could be solved by doing what the government did in the past NOTHING. Americans scream FEMA camps are the only solution for natural disasters but San Francisco recovered from the 1906 earthquake without government help. Americans insist concentration camps are the only answer to viruses but the government did nothing about a cholera outbreak in 1832. Americans say the only possible solutions to deal with illegal immigrants are to build a wall have warrantless searches DNA databases license plate scanners and build concentration camps but the US used to have open borders. Americans say the only solution to recessions is to give billion dollar bailouts to bankers who commit fraud and give welfare to the lazy but the US recovered from the Panic of 1893 without government action. The government starts a problem and offers a solution. Why not avoid starting a problem in the first place If the government starts a trade war that kills the economy and then offers bailouts why not just avoid starting a trade war in the first place If the government increases the minimum wage and regulations that kill businesses and raise prices and then offers welfare why not just reduce the minimum wage and regulations The government is not a holy god. The government is force. Why not allow the free market to handle problems The private market and charities cannot provide disaster relief The free market cannot provide medical care delivery companies railroads airports schools fire departments private mediation and security companies Do your shoes come from government shoes factories Can't churches teach morals Do you really trust the government to tell you what the truth is Does the government spend your money better than you do People don't have any personal responsibility Can't you move away from people you don't like Can't you save money to prepare for downturns Can't Americans boycott products with cheap prices instead of begging for a trade war that kills the economy Can't Americans quit low paying jobs learn a skill move to another city or start a business instead of thinking a minimum wage will magically make them rich with no unintended consequences Is tyranny something that only affects others but not you Are Americans retarded children Didn't tyranny kill millions of people in Nazi Germany the Soviet Union China and Cambodia What do we need government for anyway If a private association like the MPAA can regulate movies why can't the private market regulate other things When the TSA fingers your asshole and pulls your cock is the real purpose to protect you or to make you feel like a degraded slave When people smoke now people just call the police on them but people in the past either took some personal responsibility and ignored smokers moved away from smokers or asked smokers to go somewhere else. The problem with a police state is everyone now is either or a slave or a criminal. Who pays the taxes to pay for tyranny If smoking is dangerous can't nonprofits raise funds to pay for educational campaigns that warn of the dangers of smoking instead of outlawing smoking Can't people use the BBB to verify if a business is good or not instead of forcing companies to pay fees to get a government business license Can't private charities funded by volunteer donations provide homeless shelters and soup kitchens instead of being at forced at the point of a gun by the government to pay taxes that fund welfare Can't people use to protect themselves instead of relying on the Gestapo Can't neighbourhoods hire private security firms to protect their homes Can't the free market provide toll roads Can't the free market provide private airports Can't the free market provide private schools Can't the free market provide disaster relief instead of FEMA Can't the free market run delivery services instead of the USPS Can't the free market run railroads instead of Amtrack Think.

This is how information is transmitted. You see we've gone off on some weird tangent conversation about how to have a conversation instead of talking about the meat of what I said which is the only reason people support Trump is because they have been successfully manipulated.

You're just starting the chain at the grocery store not the theater. Yes but the chain wouldn't have existed if you didn't get infected at the movies in the first place. gt I understand risk mitigation however it's more than just don't go to the movies but carry on as usual as you seem to suggest. I'm not suggesting carry on as usual I don't know how you got that from what I said. What I'm saying is that people need food to live so they need to go to the grocery store. And if you go the the movies and the grocery store instead of just the grocery store you're putting everyone who just goes to grocery store at risk. gt Although simply banning movies sounds nice it realistically doesn't do much if people aren't actively taking adequate precautions when they do eventually venture out into public. No one's talking about just banning movie theaters but all non essential businesses. And even if people take good precautions when going out in public they're still taking a risk and people who are idiots are increasing their risk. gt At the end of the day you are responsible for the risks you expose yourself to. Sure and other people should be required not not unduly cause risk to others since many people have to take risks. Virtually no one can just never go outside or interact with someone who goes outside.

Honestly while I don't know one way or another I highly doubt if a human virus could survive in salt water and spread through the ocean and then get into the air with evaporation.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Flip-dabDab,t2_1ejzb1oz,In these cases I do generally take the reactive responsive position rather than the preemptive protective position. I do believe a person can sue someone for damages of such things but that in most cases it is the role of government to respond once a snake gets loose rather than preemptively shut down the snake breeder before anything happens. Let then prove themselves whether for good or ill In a sense this is taking the view that liberty is a higher value than life and that once liberty is taken from someone the situation requires responsive justice. The line between the liberties of two individuals is at the point of conflict not at the point of a mere potential future conflict. If a case of imminence is strongly presented I suppose it should be up to the community to decide whether or not the case has sufficient social authority but within the constraints of constitution to avoid lynch mobs and witch burnings.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,RDwelve,t2_12exo3,One thing I've realized during this pandemic is that it's not entirely accurate or helpfful to use deaths as a metric. In the case of Italy for example the virus mainly killed 80 year olds many of them with several preexisting conditions. So what exactly would it mean if let's say ALL people 85 and older died from this virus. Yeah the death rate THIS year would spike immensely but what about next year Well next year we'd have a huge decrease in total deaths which feels odd. Same thing for next year... Or another way to look at it how many people die yearly if a country has 80 million people and the average life expectancy is 80 years What I'm trying to say is that while it sucks to have tens of thousands 80 year olds die it's nowhere near as bad as having tens of thousands of 20 year olds die but a look at simple death rates wouldn't be able to reflect that AT ALL which is very problematic for a metric. Also the fucking piece of shit that created the 2. 2 million dead Americans number should be in jail or have at least all of his qualifications stripped away from him and forbidden to teach ever at all. For fuck sake people get in trouble for yelling fire in a crowded place but setting the world economy on fire with retarded predictions based on absolutely nothing is somehow fine Wtf...
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,BobbyTomale,t2_9840f,gt What does this mean specifically I don't follow what individual needs insurance can be tailored to... Cover less for a lower price in healthier people. gt Exactly this is the only way insurance as a concept works. If you only got insurance as you age and go up in risk factors insurance stops making sense because the costs are astronomical. Right. Which makes it not insurance at all but some kind of weird health care financing that shields the customer from the actual price. gt By not carrying health insurance you become a burden on the system if an accident happens and drive up costs for everyone else. The thing driving up costs is not young healthy people having unexpected accidents. Most health care spending is end of life care. The thing driving prices up are medicare underpaying doctors who then shift the price onto people with private insurance customers being shielded from knowledge of the actual prices and the entire market being geared toward hmo coverage.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Devil-sAdvocate,t2_11t9ba,It wasn't about speech it was about his case on wrongful arrest. He claimed because of his speech he was then retaliated against and wrongfully arrested. re The justices gave the example of a person who has been complaining about police conduct who is arrested for jaywalking which rarely results in an arrest. The justices said in a case like that if the person can prove that he was arrested when other jaywalkers had not been he could move forward with a retaliatory arrest lawsuit. SMH. By SCOTUS own example he should be able to move forward with a lawsuit. I doubt many people are ever arrested for standing to close THEY likely walked up and stood to close to HIM but we don't know Talking loudly is also not something that usually gets people arrested especially in the middle of a big party and I doubt anyone else was arrested for it that night.

But the government forces me and gives incentives to my employer to buy comprehensive coverage. Exactly this is the only way insurance as a concept works. If you only got insurance as you age and go up in risk factors insurance stops making sense because the costs are astronomical. Healthcare is one of the few things in life that we can be sure every single person will need at some point and as such it's the only form of insurance that makes sense to mandate that everyone carry. By not carrying health insurance you become a burden on the system if an accident happens and drive up costs for everyone else.

Your stupid fucking selfish ass thinks its OKAY for a person to go out contract the virus and spread it to essential workers their family neighbors etc... The person that you feel has a right to go out can literally become a mass murderer in one afternoon and not even know it. Just stop thinking. Stay home. Masturbate. Play video games. Teach the dog a new trick. Fuck the wife...whatever but stay home. You have no rational logical argument. What you have said here is just plain fucking stupid.

That experiment is rationally idealized situation. They measured how an alpha particle beam is scattered when it strikes a thin metal foil. This very rarely happens in reality but we can still take this as part of an understanding of how the world works and use it to explain things even if the real world scenario doesn't fit perfectly within the idealized situation. Economics is the same thing. Even we humans can make simple predictions like pandemic is coming masks will be in demand supply will probably be be down since demand is up and price stay same from our understanding of supply and demand.

This pandemic is a pick your poison scenario. Either enact measures early or enact them later or enact them never. Enact early means fewer measures are needed but you need foresight and central planning. Later enactment of measures means that you need more and you still have people dying. And if you never enact measures then enjoy seeing people die and the economy screech to a halt as people realize the problem and start to panic. Rioting and looting helps the economy right

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mc2222,t2_5nnka,because the more people get sick at the same time the less productive the business is. The more people get sick at the same time the less productive their suppliers are. Because if a businesses oldest most experienced employees die this negatively impacts that business. best to limit this number. Employees will have to stay home to take care of sick children etc. The more people get sick at the same time the more overburdened the healthcare system. When the healthcare system is overwhelmed all patients suffer worse outcomes including their usual patient load who can't access healthcare services. Treating 10 of the sick population is more expensive when more people get sick. consumer confidence would be impacted their spending would go down none of these things are conducive to a good economy.

Well the first option assumes that you know you have the virus and that your family all have underlying medical conditions that give them a 100 chance of dying from it and your second option pretends like we've only been given advice instead of a law enforceable mandate. Neither of these align with reality or the topic of discussion and I think you know that but you don't care because you're nothing more than a deceitful and manipulative child who has no intention of ever arguing your point in good faith.

The notion that government can do something better than those with the most on the line is absolutely Preposterous and can only come from an absolute lack of understanding about a World War.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,D3vilM4yCry,t2_cgvihf,gt For example if I asked you do you want 1000 or 1 I can probably predict with certainty that almost all people although they do behave irrationally sometimes will choose 1000. But that example which i acknowledge is extremely simplified isn't reality. It exist to prove a point in an idealized situation. To make another somewhat less idealized but still overly simplified example Do you want 1000 or this medicine costs 100 000 Which one will the average person choose Depends on the circumstances. Are they in desperate need of the medicine Are they not in need now but will be in the future Do they not need it at all and can sell it for a profit Then factor in the all the irrational choices in this situation. Not so easy to predict anymore. Economics is great for analyzing general trends in normal market circumstances. But to apply economic principles to all situations and to declare anything that goes against those principles as incorrect is a leap.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HectorHuntsNazis,t2_5zgz72cb,I GUESS that nobody has told you about whats happening yet... Apparently there is some kind of deadly virus that is calling Americans at over 1000 people a day and is multiplying. It is showing np signs of slowing down and is only growing larger and faster at this point. We are still weeks from cresting to the downhill side of this thing. Its going to get bad. It can travel from person to person person to surface or surface to person. There is no known cure or vaccine for it yet. They recommend that every isolate themselves and stay home because right now that is the ONLY WEAPON WE HAVE TO FIGHT IT. Preventing the spread of this disease means that we have to lesson our chances of exposing ourselves to it or exposing others to it if we carry it and not know it. It IS a national security threat and many can die from it and are going to die from it. Its really really serious. SO THAT IS FUCKING WHY YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR STUPID ASS AT HOME. SO YOU DONT FUCKING KILL ANY OTHER AMERICANS WITH YOUR FUCKING STUPIDITY. BECAUSE YOU MAY MURDER OTHER AMERICANS ASSHOLE. THAT is fucking why you may be arrested. ENOUGH with the bullshit.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Digital-Genesis,t2_5t035esi,gt any judgement of imminence is mere opinion. Yes but there are educated informed opinions and then there are just wild ignorant guesses. If someone builds a nuclear power plant a mile from your house the threat it presents depends on your level of education and experience with the subject. Some people hear nuclear and immediately oppose it because it sounds scary. Others see an infinitesimal negligible threat like being hit by a meteor. The imminence of a threat can be calculated or at least estimated by someone who is well familiar and educated on the subject. Regarding a less explosive example I think it's universally agreed by libertarians that my rights end were yours begin. Since government is not a valid authority on such things let's forget about what is legal and illegal. The reason I came up with the explosive example is precisely because of the unknown threat it poses. How educated and experienced is the bomb maker How volatile are the ingredients What percentage of people who make these kinds of explosives end up accidentally blowing themselves up Another vague or indeterminate threat would be a venomous snake breeder. Should such a person have the right to breed snakes next door to you Depends on what risks you're willing to deal with. Are the odds of a snake escaping and crawling into your house one in ten or one in a billion Hard to say. Libertarians are generally pro recreational drugs. Should I have the right to cook meth in my house when there's a risk of a toxic cloud of smoke appearing that will kill or seriously hurt whoever is around I guess it depends on the meth cook and how experienced he is. These are all fringe cases of course but these are the cases were moral ambiguity exists so there is room for discussion.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mitsandgames,t2_4yunvwss,Plenty of people would like to see stricter regulation of herbicides and pesticides. Some people think businesses are going to protect people and do the right thing without oversight. Some don't give a shit. Others think it might cost more than it's worth. The US although sometimes slow to react to known carcinogens does sometimes ban them. If the body stack can compete with the dollar stack. The virus is very contagious and someone can go from okay to dead in a matter of days. That's the estimate if people aren't doing dumb shit like acting likes it a vacation licking shit in stores and coughing on people. Even without the malicious intent people still spread it with quickness. All these people using their freedoms to kill others is some dumb shit. Experts say to social distance and do these things. People do opposite. Government steps in sometimes with shitty overreaching policies in addition to just trying to tell people it's a lockdown. What would be super cool if people weren't assholes and it would be even cooler if elected officials would roll back overreaching power grabs. Somehow the giant assholes who always get elected don't give a shit about protecting rights unless they can campaign on it and then forget about them. Too many dead in Italy to actually have funerals patients in the hallways and no places at the morgues so it's clearly not business as usual for hard hit areas. Since it's still picking up steam in the states some assholes are still acting like it's the common cold. In addition to some of the doctors and nurses treating the virus also dying from it. Either way it's a shit show no matter where you stand on anything at the moment.

Idiots going to the movies are only a risk to other idiots that go to the movies. They are not a risk to people who chose to stay home. How are you this ignorant about the nature of a pandemic Someone goes to the movies and gets infected then they go to the grocery store and infect someone who follows the proper guidelines and is only going once a week. Then that person could infect someone who only stays home because they're immunocompromised but needs someone to take care of them and get them groceries. And maybe that person who only goes to a grocery store once a week works as a RN at a nursing home and then we have another nursing home getting wiped out. The only people not impacted are people who never leave their home and never come in contact with anyone who's left their home which just isn't possible for virtually everyone.

If you are alone you can't possible harm anyone else. Also we very much know what the chances are to infect someone else. The worst is living together. So your family and nursing homes are at high risk. Same goes for the the hospital itself. Next in line is work and leisure activies. Random encounters like coming across someone on the street or even while doing shopping is lower and that's a good thing. Social distancing makes sense but only if the social distancing makes sense. So yes don't continue with the NBA trade fairs or leave bars and clubs open. But someone take a walk outside or something like this Totally fine.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Takashishifu,t2_38y0hy5z,Here's where we can agree to disagree. Yes I agree that economics has a lower barrier of what is considered science that is accepted into the community but there are well studied phenomena such as supply and demand that can be considered predictable. For example if I asked you do you want 1000 or 1 I can probably predict with certainty that almost all people although they do behave irrationally sometimes will choose 1000. Once you start making big predictions with a huge amount of confounding variables like increasing FED rates will increase GDP then that's soft science.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,PoopMobile9000,t2_3ynprgy8,No none of those matter in a pandemic crisis like this. One is irrelevant we don't need supplies going to whoever can afford them which is the reality not who wants them Google can buy a lot more masks at higher prices than the Detroit hospital system but I guarantee you the hospital employees want them more we need them dispersed as widely as possible according to medical need. As for two it does not encourage supply lines to increase it encourages people to insert themselves into the supply lines and slow them down in order to extract rents. In the normal course the markets will excise these rent seekers but that takes time and these aren't normal times. And in any case the problem isn't distribution but supply If you want to encourage more masks to be constructed you need to provide an incentive to mask manufacturers not distributors and the way to do that is for the government to guarantee purchase of large volumes so there's no risk of re tasked manufacturing facilities over producing and being stuck with a surplus. Because these are durable goods the government can absorb any surplus and then sell it off over time as the crisis wanes. This is not a market issue this is a massive but temporary external shock so government intervention is necessary to preserve the structures of the market so it can restart when all this is over. The free market system is the best way to organize a society but it is not magic it doesn't automatically and definitionally create the best results in all circumstances.

I think it's just people who are realizing how bad the neo liberal corporate welfare for the past few decades has been and how fucked the US is but they don't have the education or intelligence to observe how all this growing inequality in the US is tied to socialist policy. Like this generation by nearly all metrics is worse than their parents generation overall and it's not a surprise that the people screaming the loudest about how it's not their fault has the most adherents though they are also not screaming about how their policy proposals will lead to more inequality rather than less so.

That's not what Libertarianism is about and as much as the T D and conservative goons screech now that they've lost all their moderator roles here this subreddit will never ban someone over political affiliation as it would be in violation of the core Libertarian ideal of protecting freedom of speech.

People are making constant effort to prove causation to the limits of human understanding. And more over the universe exists independently of humanity. In essence we're trying to figure out how something that exists apart from us is organized. It is a relatively static predictable thing that we can measure objectively. Economics is using human behavior inherently irrational to prove human behavior in rational idealized situations. That simply doesn't work.

Adding to that the government doesn't have to think too much about being profitable because it's financing itself through taxes anyway so the government ideally doesn't have to focus on efficiency and can rather focus on effect.

I mean you can depending on the material it's thicker the President said. Trump also said that new recommendations for civilians using masks will come out soon. Facts First Though he was addressing what citizens should do Trump's claim that scarves can work better than masks is not supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance to health care workers. While scarves may offer some protection the CDC's advice describes scarves as a possible last resort if masks are not available. When masks are no longer available the CDC says workers might use homemade masks e.g bandana scarf for care of patients with COVID 19 as a last resort. The guidance also states that caution should be exercised when considering this option and that face shields should be used in addition to these homemade masks. So the CDC says scarves are not good enough FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS. We are not talking about healthcare workers. We are talking about citizens. And yes a scarf can and will help prevent the spread of infection from human transmissible diseases by cutting down on your ability to inhale the pathogen. What Trump was saying is accurate. You are simply choosing to look at a deliberately wrong interpretation of it. Not only does the CDC not say scarves don't work they do work you retard the advice listed from the CDC is for HEALTHCARE WORKERS NOT NORMAL CITIZENS. Holy fuck you're illiterate and retarded. gt Since Sunday. But will still lag behind Germany Italy and South Korea in tests per million. Lol holy shit you fucking retards will always find some thing to be angry about won't you This is why no one gives a fuck what you think. gt The federal government has controlled literally everything about the response so far. Individual states have been prohibited from sourcing their own tests because of federal guidelines and control. Yes and now the fed is starting to loosen those restrictions. Which is what they should've done from the beginning. And which you are adamantly opposed to. gt gt You've been wrong about literally every single thing so far gt LOL. No. Lol says the guy who DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHEN TRUMP'S CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE STARTED. You're so categorically wrong and retarded that I honestly pity you. gt This is such an idiotic statement from someone trying to insist that Trump Big Daddy Government himself is doing everything right.

I haven't given a personal definition of essential so far you don't actually know what I think of transportation in this situation. If we are operating on the government's definition of essential then rideshare services fit due to the need by workers in essential services. Also again the article you shared offers information you omit to prove your point. gt According to Dr. John Ioannidis profiles.stanford.edu M.D professor of medicine and of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University you shouldn't worry if the subway is your only option right now. The risk would be extremely low with pubic transportation or rideshares he tells Bustle. We have no evidence that would lead us to use one in preference over the other. Instead Ioannidis suggests the public shifts its focus to telling people who feel sick bustle.com to stay at home instead of interrupting people's daily commute. The concern over public transportation is the proximity of people to one another not the nature of the service itself. And sense COVID 19 can last on surfaces for extended periods of time there isn't any sure way to state that rideshare services are inherently less risky than public transportation.

Technology to implement the safety features formerly referenced may not have existed at all may not have existed in commercial applications or may have been cost prohibitive so retaining risk would have been worth the cost What would you say was the capacity for the average consumer in the late 19th century early 20th century to hold a large corporation liable for damages What about today's You're also ignoring the massively different social landscape. Look at food ethics the awareness it's brought to the consumer and the subsequent options that have been brought to market for those seeking such products. What about the bang up job regulators in the US have done preventing carcinogenic additives from being added to our processed foods Why are these banned in other countries but not here Is science different in other regions of the world or have regulators been incentivized to turn a blind eye to these additives An anecdotal reference in my city it's a poorly kept secret that politically connected people can pay off health inspectors for favorable health inspection results.

Oh sorry I forgot I'm talking to a Libertarian and is incapable of seeing the big picture. So let me explain it like you're 5. The shelter in place laws are keeping those places without any laws safe. Because people that ARE infected aren't traveling to the places that aren't Which works fine until someone who isn't infected decides to travel to someplace that they THINK isn't infected because no one is showing symptoms and then brings it back to their own community that previously wasn't infected. That's why EVERYBODY should be staying in place not just the places that are currently infected.

Like how many people die because of the lockdown and not because of covid I know of people having trouble getting medication for example. Obviously somethings can be improved no lockdown is going to be the same. How terrible are regulations in various countries and the damage they caused in delays in different countries How much damage to the economy occurs as a result of the lockdown An interesting thing is that this is an intentional crashing of markets which may actually be a healthy thing like intentional controlled forest fires to prevent much larger natural disaster like forest fires. Not saying the flu is as bad as covid but the flu does kill lots of people as well but would it be worth it to lockdown the economy for the flu Maybe it is or maybe we will do a voluntary lockdown during flu seasons as a normal thing having learned a lot from this.

From the CDC cdc.gov gt The federal government gt The federal government derives its authority for isolation and quarantine from the Commerce Clause of the U.S Constitution. gt Acts to prevent the entry of communicable diseases into the United States. Quarantine and isolation may be used at U.S ports of entry. gt Is authorized to take measures to prevent the spread of communicable diseases between states. gt May accept state and local assistance in enforcing federal quarantine. gt May assist state and local authorities in preventing the spread of communicable diseases. gt State local and tribal authorities gt Enforce isolation and quarantine within their borders. gt It is possible for federal state local and tribal health authorities to have and use all at the same time separate but coexisting legal quarantine power in certain events In the event of a conflict federal law is supreme. gt State Local and Tribal Law gt States have police power functions to protect the health safety and welfare of persons within their borders. To control the spread of disease within their borders states have laws to enforce the use of isolation and quarantine. There's long standing precedent for the government to issue orders to mitigate the spread of disease within its borders Source sacbee.com storylink cpy gt The law is clear the government has broad power in a public health emergency to take the steps needed to stop the spread of a communicable disease. In 1905 the Supreme Court declared Upon the principle of self defense of paramount necessity a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members. There is no right to put the health of others in danger and to act in a way that risks the collapse of our health care system. gt This is not a new principle. A few years after the end of the Revolutionary War Philadelphia was isolated to control the spread of yellow fever. By the time the Constitution was drafted and approved quarantine was already a well established form of public health regulation. States as part of their police power were deemed to have the authority to order quarantines to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. In 1926 the Supreme Court wrote it is well settled that a state in the exercise of its police power may establish quarantines against human beings or animals or plants. gt The court emphatically stated But the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good.

The reason we are trying to slow the infection is for the latter two events. The first is unlikely to occur. gt Govt mandates ARE needed. People will NOT cooperate otherwise. People were already cooperating. Businesses were already making adjustments both to work environments and employee welfare. Local municipalities were already advising communities of risks and alternative resources. Not everyone will cooperate. Government mandates won't change that. gt Its hilarous to think that people are going to just do the right thing becaue its the right thing. Who's suggesting that You are arguing against stances I'm not taking. People already were doing the right thing because it was sensible not because it was the right thing to do. gt Thats not human nature and we can see that in evidence by looking out your window.

Again people already were doing what they could and following the advice they could because it's the sensible thing to do to mitigate risk for yourself and your family.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,D3vilM4yCry,t2_cgvihf,I'm going to move the goalposts here and amend my question a bit because I should've anticipated you would use non essentials as an example and forgo the conclusions of the very articles you share. Do you have a positive example of price gouging being effective in maintaining a necessary supply of goods in an emergency situation And the GWU paper operates on the assumption that consumers are simply misled about the efficacy of the free market and that government should educate people about how it works. Which imo is actually a condemnation of price gouging and the free market. A truly free market can not operate effectively when there is information asymmetry. Price gouging thrives on that same asymmetry with consumers unaware or misled about the actual state of supply leading to a run up on demand. This is especially true in an emergency. That entire paper isn't factually demonstrating that price gouging is good with statistical analysis of events and responses but presupposes that the free market is naturally correct and people just need to experience it to realize the benefits. That the market is right and the consumers are wrong and need to be educated which doesn't make any sense because the market exists because of the consumer's demand

Healthcare services don't work under even idealized free market economic principles because healthcare isn't like pizza can you think of some reasons why what people pay isn't related to the quality of healthcare services available to the public or to public health outcomes can you think of some reasons why and the public being priced out of healthcare including preventive care altogether is as much rationing as the socialized gubmint rationing you think as the only alternative in your mind. You have the sum of human knowledge at your fingertips but you're still a dumbass.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HorseWhisperer32,t2_5dlrio5z,It is actually factually incorrect btw that's what belief is. But let us move on. Let us talk about Venezuela and China as well. Venezuela It is estimated that there are 9 15 mln guns in civilian hands in the country according to a 2009 report. Population in 2009 was 29 mln. So roughly half of the country owns guns on average. So why is Venezuela's government still standing 1. Venezuela has a soldier for every rebel. Which is simply not feasible 2. The opposition is not as strong as we might think. Yeah that socialist government put them into a giant whole. But guess what People are not really that smart they consume local media and they remember all the free shit they got a few years back. It is much easier for them to believe that their problems are external rather than the fault of their government. So they do not bother to rebel. China It has some of the strictest gun control in the world. But once again. Is it the lack of guns that prevents an uprising or the fact that people support the government Chinese government goes after minorities both religious and ethnic or after political enemies. Average people do not give a shit about either. Chinese government brought the people prosperity and wealth at least that's what they claim and revolutions do NOT happen when people's bellies are full. Honk Kong's revolt was doomed guns or no guns it is completely reliant on supplies from mainland and they did not get any support from the rest of the country. Divide and conquer is the main tactic used by dictatorship to stay in power and guns do not change it. If anything it makes it easy to get people to kill each other while keeping your hands clean.

You cannot separate the behavior of institutions from the people who operate them. All institutional behavior is systemic leaders are bound up within the complex of incentives and structural constraints of the system the process that generates and selects leaders is part of the system and the manifestation of bad leadership reflects the system's inability to prevent or mitigate the effects of bad leaders in critical roles. Political institutions are inherently susceptible to bad leadership corruption perverse incentives knowledge limitations rent seeking ideological zeal and pure malfeasance. The idea that you're going to ever have consistently good effective and trustworthy leadership in a government is a ridiculous pipe dream. A system that doesn't have sufficient structural constraints to limit the damage its own bad leadership can do is a defective system.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,3720-To-One,t2_3yvv5m5h,Here is a pretty good summary youtu.be
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,oyuno_miyumi,t2_58ymcup1,A lot of Americans think this is only as bad as getting the flu would be. Which might be true if we had the treatments and vaccines in place but we don't so it's closer to getting pneumonia which can hospitalize even healthy people. And that's the problem. The other problem is that it doesn't take long for people to stop following arduous safety procedures if they have to do them every single day which will accelerate the spread of this. If we send everybody back to work tomorrow within a month at least 25 of the population would end up hospitalized. We don't have the health system to deal with those kind of numbers. At that point it's not just the people with COVID 19 at risk of death from no hospital support it's everyone who gets all the other stuff too. Broken legs and gunshot wounds won't have the support of the healthcare system if all the resources are too busy fighting COVID 19. The reason my analogy is correct is because right now getting COVID 19 is medically as bad as being shot with a bullet. How badly it affects you is analogous to where exactly you get shot. Some people would get shot in the leg and would be able to survive without a hospital while a lot of people would get shot in the abdomen and need a hospital's help to survive and a few people would get shot in the head and not survive regardless of how much help the hospital can give. I'm subscribed to my county's mailing list for COVID 19. Here's the update sent at midnight As of April 2 lt my gt County has 159 positive cases of COVID 19 4 of those are deaths 1 in their 40s 2 in their 70s 1 in their 80s lt irrelevant number gt negative tests have been reported to date. Of the 159 cases 2 are 10 19 15 are 20 29 17 are 30 39 28 are 40 49 32 are 50 59 27 are 60 69 21 are 70 79 and 17 are 80 89. That is the best the hospitals can do right now. 4 of 159. Round that up to 160 and that's still 1 death for every 40 people. 1 in every 40. Tell me my analogy of a gun that could hit anybody anywhere no matter how well you try to aim it is incorrect.

The first weekend of lockdown thousands of large adult children flocked to every damn beach in the state as if it were July 4th so they were closed. sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com If they don t fine this guy a thousand other jackasses will go to the beach and none of them will keep driving if the beach is already busy. It s not his fault. It s the other ten million assholes who can t behave. In case you think it s just California you d be mistaken. Hundreds of people flocked to Mt Washington to ski Tucks in New Hampshire the day after the lockdown. Some of them required rescue even. They had to close the national park the next day.

The physical distance is enforceable and contaminated surfaces can be cleaned and treated as dirty. If we treat every door knob and public surface the way we treat public bathroom doorknobs we will drastically reduce the rate of spreading.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,MisterCommonMarket,t2_2w37epoi,Why is it spreading so well in Iran Italy and Spain then Spreading pretty well in Florida too seems to be quite warm over there. From your own article by the way businessinsider.com op 1 amp r US amp IR T Many experts doubt that is the case though new early research does suggest higher humidity and temperatures can decrease the number of people infected by an average person with the virus. This could slightly decrease the coronavirus' spread in Northern Hemisphere countries like the US and Italy come summertime. The problem with current studies on corona virus is that they are of often very bad with very small numbers of tested people and rushed implementation and study design. For accurate data we will have to wait a much longer time. No large scale studies have really been done at this stage. So even if it helped the effect will be pretty minor. Warm weather won't save us and if it did save us we would be right back to the current problems when fall rolls around so I don't really understand what the point of making a big deal about possible seasonality is.

Maybe if you payed attention to what people in this sub say you would see that we are against big companies being bailed out far more than we are against unemployment.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Takashishifu,t2_38y0hy5z,Bahaha just minutes ago you were saying how it's a soft science and now you're latching onto a single conclusion in the entire paper on how to IMPROVE price gouging laws and how they don't work. It didn't take much for someone to prove to you that was true did it Now I know you only believe information when they confirm what you were thinking before. Learn about confirmation bias. The paper showed how the current price gouging laws don't work and suggested improvements to combat the current weaknesses. Her proposed solutions to the problems she studied and detailed in the paper have not been studied. You literally ignored everything else in the paper like these points An artificially low price put in place by anti price gouging law has several detrimental effects on the economy. First it fails to regulate goods to those with the greatest demand who will bear the new price to obtain the good. For example someone who owns a house severely impacted by a hurricane may be willing to pay a higher price for gasoline to fuel his car in order to drive to his out of town family as compared to his neighbor who simply wants it for his lawnmower. With fixed prices price can no longer serve as an imperfect indicator to signal an individual's need and the resource will go to whoever rushes to the gas station first. Second because the price of the good is lower than what the market will bear the increase in buyer demand will quickly result in shortages and may create higher transactional cost for buyers.

For one thing in winter months people may cluster together more indoors increasing the number of folks at risk of becoming infection by someone who's contagious. gt But he says COVID 19 seems more akin to the seasonal cold. And up to a third of common colds are caused by coronaviruses. In addition there's the matter of transmission. Viruses spread through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. And the droplets are more likely to spread under certain conditions. npr.org gt For that reason he says I do think seasonality will play a role.

It's not fair to let one person get away with it just because everyone else is doing what they're SUPPOSED to be doing and staying at home.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,moak0,t2_bzyig,Honestly the whole government is such a shitshow at this point that I have a hard time getting worked up about this. I don't want to pay for other people's healthcare. But at the same time government interference in the healthcare system has fucked it up so much that I have a hard time blaming the uninsured and underinsured. It's not like people have a lot of great options and that's not always their fault. The whole system needs to be overhauled. Ideally it would be overhauled in a way that allows market forces to encourage innovation and drive prices down. But until then it's still a shitshow and why not let this happen too. It's like if you've got a room in your house that badly needs to be repainted. Chipped faded paint cracks in the drywall etc. Then your three year old president nephew comes over and starts drawing on the walls in crayon. It sets a bad precedent and you don't want him thinking that that's ok but it keeps him distracted you've already given him the crayons and honestly you're just exhausted so why not just let him go at it You're just going to repaint anyway.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,PerpetualAscension,t2_16k8zg,gt Explain how the government would protect someone civil right against a virus spread by selfish idiots Youre going to have to elaborate. Are you talking about people who are infected and are walking around People who are infected need to be quarantined. Explain how you expect universal healthcare to work when the government cant stop a virus from spreading Who is producing the life saving masks and test kits The private sector. The FDA did not allow tests to be conducted until everyone jumped through their bureaucratic hoops. The FDA Continues to Actively Undermine America s Response mises.org From the beginning of this battle the FDA has slowed American medical companies' ability to respond at full capacity. For example it was FDA regulations that significantly slowed the creation of testing kits in the early days of the crisis. While the CDC s government labs were creating fatally flawed COVID 19 tests private labs were desperately trying to receive waivers to ramp up their own efforts. On Feburary 24 the US Association of Public Health Laboratories made desperate appeals to get into the game. Although the FDA tweaked its rule five days later to allow labs to begin testing kits though it still barred their active use without approval it wasn t until March 16 that the FDA finally removed its grasp on the private sector and allowed labs get approval through state agencies. gt Explain how the government would protect someone civil right against a virus spread by selfish idiots What if the selfish idiots in your analogy is the government who has too much power and is putting citizens' lives at stake There are too many processes going on at once for any governing body' to govern effectively in contrast to free markets. The fact that no given individual or set of individuals controls or coordinates all the innumerable economic activities in a market economy does not mean these things just happen randomly or chaotically. Each consumer producer retailer landlord or worker makes individual transactions with other individuals on whatever terms they can mutually agree on. Prices convey these terms not just to the particular individuals immediately involved but throughout the whole economic system and indeed throughout the world. If someone else somewhere has a better product or service that fact gets conveyed and acted upon through prices without any elected official or planning commission having to issue orders to consumers or producers indeed faster than any planners could assemble the information on which to base their orders. However overwhelming it might be for a government agency to try to keep track of 24 million prices a country with more than a hundred million people can far more easily keep track of those prices individually because no given individual or enterprise has to keep track of more than the relatively few prices that are relevant to their own decision making. The over all coordination of these innumerable isolated decisions takes places through the effect of supply and demand on prices and the effect of prices on the behaviour of consumers and producers. Money talks and people listen. Their reactions are usually faster than central planners could get their reports together. While telling people what to do might seem to be a more rational or orderly way of coordinating an economy it has turned out repeatedly to be far less effective in practice.

It's self regulating. Many insurance companies already don't insure companies that don't practice the proper safety features that often exceed what government regulations require of them E amp S markets may offer solutions at a drastically higher cost and lacking many of the coverage options the standard insurance market offers so business want to avoid this at all cost. Retaining all risk self insuring is an option for large companies but they'll still want to avoid risk due to public perception and social backlash.

People are still gathering at beaches anyways. Look at Florida Oregon and California. Sure the beaches are big but if you get a ton of people there the size doesn't matter.

Are you Unless I'm missing something I'll consider them though. Starting with high speed internet. Monopolies would be formed with the first company into the market. I don't see providing internet where there was none as a problem. But then costs get too high well considering they've only recently gotten internet I would assume they'd discontinue service. For them an inconvenience not a problem. I don't consider a company providing Healthcare to the poor and invalid as a problem. That would be a good thing.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,MisterCommonMarket,t2_2w37epoi,There is no evidence that temperatures have any mitigating effect on the spread of this virus and previous SARS strains showed no weakness to temperature. MERS for example spreads just fine in the middle east from camels to humans and COVID 19 is spreading just fine in Iran right now and its not cold over there. When you are this uninformed you probably should not speak so authoritatively about what is or is not going to happen.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,homerjaysimpleton,t2_8rqvw,Thanks for providing a thought out response. I can agree for reasons you laid out that higher spending doesn't necessarily mean bad. Perhaps a better metric would be availability access to receiving healthcare needs. In general though Does higher spending mean less availability for the general populace Does less access due to increased burden of costs encourage putting health issues off and that may lead to even higher costs later on I would say yes.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Chrisc46,t2_ycno6,gt I am talking about which regulations actually make the situation worse overall I'd suggest that regulations that infringe on economic and personal liberty do make the situation worse. They prevent legitimate market pressures and decrease the ability and incentive to improve. gt Also who gets to define what natural rights are It's a fair question but I think the answer is fairly apparent. Any action or inaction that one could conceivably take without the forceful provision of another is a natural right. As an example you have the natural right to not have your life taken from you but you do not have the natural right to have your life provided or maintained for you.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Ed_Radley,t2_etyvw,It s about accurately tying risk to reward. Nobody will be willing to take the most important risks in the future if there isn t a sufficient enough reward for their efforts. Power is an illusion until there s violence to back it up and the government has a nigh monopoly on being able to force people to do what s against their interests and rights as long as there s a majority of lawmakers in favor sometimes requiring a 3 5 or 2 3 majority but again this is equivalent to mob rule.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Markiskus,t2_3xm432,Thank you for stating the obvious i know they have purpose just as a stop light has a purpose. I just didn't fathom orders from a 16 year old was an actual charge. obviously wreckless endangerment disorderly conduct is prohibited and I would have ordinarily assumed that would be one of few things you could possibly be cited for. When you ignore a bouncer at a bar you don't get cited for ignoring a security guard. I just find it funny getting busted by baywatch lol.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jstgonnasendit,t2_5spufw7v,It really depends where you live. It's impossible for police in rural areas to enforce this like they could in Atlanta's concentrated residential areas. They are more focused on public gatherings and cross state travel. Stay in georgia avoid highly populated areas or gathering with other people and you're fine
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,TheRedTomahawk,t2_1f2j3se,I don't use drugs not because of any moral issue with drugs because I don't like wasting money on unnecesary shit.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,I_Am_U,t2_692ii,I actually have a family member who was left to slowly die from cancer because treatment costs that would have been covered in a socialized Healthcare System were denied to her. Compare the number of people with and without health coverage in the USA versus socialized Healthcare systems. There's no comparison.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,D3vilM4yCry,t2_cgvihf,Let's be clear I think you're entire argument is full of crap. One of the lessons I learned from my Econ 101 class is that basic economic theory is at best and idealized model of rational behavior in a given market. Sure trends have been observed and measured but economics at its core is a soft science and the further you study the more apparent it is that modeling can only take you so far. So when people declare supply and demand like it is some inviolable statement of existence I roll my eyes every time. You may think price gouging is a viable response but to behave as if is the only correct response and beyond argument is staggeringly misguided. This isn't physics or chemistry. economics is limited in its ability to predict human behavior and should be used in much the same fashion. gt Will companies be more motivated to produce said good if they were able to charge more for it What do you think If companies could make 10 in profit per roll of toilet paper vs 50 wouldn't you think they'd divert more resources into making that good Ideally yes. In reality not really.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DasBeefcat,t2_k6aoyos,As someone who has studied cartels and criminal gangs south of us for many years a border wall which he implied stops drugs and people from coming across won't do a fucking thing. They rarely walk the drugs across the desert to get them here. Cartels will boat it across fly it across ship it across walk it across shoot it across go underground to get it across. There are infinite ways for them to do these things. A wall is a total waste of tax payer resources. Any time Trump talks about it as some sort of success he is lying. The only thing that can stop cartels is stopping this ridiculous failed war on drugs and move towards legalizing decriminalizing drugs. Anything other than that approach is a lie and they 100 know it. That is reality. The problem is that conservatives and evangelicals and police unions and the Mexican Govt and the CIA and the prison corporations and on and on and on do not want that happening. So they continue this lie. As for price of drugs going up you need to do some research on how the cartels work. The cartels know exactly where the price point of their product needs to be. Just like any other company out there. They will find a way to continue selling that product for that price no matter what. They do that because someone else will find a way to. Cutting them out of the market.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Blawoffice,t2_4rbpnc37,The US is ranked 18th worst right now with a quickly increasing death rate and several weeks behind other countries.

So Trump stopped caring and now you can't blame Trump
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,kriegercontainers,t2_peh57,100 of the time I get someone who suggests a logical fallacy. 100 with progressives and liberals. What is it with you people Why do you constantly think you are really smart and smarter than everyone else. YOU AREN'T You legitimately are not smarter than everyone else who disagrees with you. It's not a strawman. It's 100 your argument. If you can't follow an argument you are an idiot. It doesn't make it a logical fallacy. It's not an ad hominem. You hate Republicans. It's half the country. You hate half the country. gt this timeline serves to disprove the timeline that Trump is suggesting regarding Democrats pushing for impeachment over preparation for the virus. It doesn't It's just a rambling list of things you don't like. All of the ranking Democrats argued that Trump should not ban travel from China. All. of. them. ALL OF THEM. Democrats did not take this as seriously as Trump. There is ample proof of it.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Chrisc46,t2_ycno6,gt I also dont see why it's a big deal for insurance companies to pay for preventive care. This is definitely one of the few hypocritical aspects of the plan I laid out. Really it's for pragmatic purposes based on economic and behavioral incentive. People are more likely to do something slightly inconvenient if it provides a discount than to do it purely because it's included in the original price. Overall it's a better way to encourage the acquisition of preventative care and it's one less cost associated with insurance for all parties involved. gt Lastly their isnt anything wrong about insurance also acting as a healthcare payment plan. I don't disagree except it separates the consumer from the pricing and purchasing mechanisms. In the end it becomes less economically efficient for the consumer because the pressure of their market choices are eroded. Prices rise choice decreases. gt what is a catastrophic plan I suppose it depends on the company offering the service but I'd suggest anything unexpected or unforeseen could be considered catastrophic. I expect it could also be tied to deductibles of varying levels. Maybe 500 is catastrophic to some but 5000 is to others. I think I'd probably prefer the market to develop membership based primary care private competitive specialty care associated with basic primary care and discount incentivized insurance coverage for unexpected care beyond primary care. Well it's how I'd prefer to purchase care for myself and my family. A free market would likely develop many alternatives to meet the desires of others.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Boronthemoron,t2_lmon3,Thanks that's a good point that no one has raised with me before. I think if it was a workmanship issue then the doctor should be obliged to redo it. If it was bad luck then they would get another payment yes. How do you discern the two I don't have a good answer for that unfortunately but surely poor workmanship would be an issue for any system and so they must be a way to manage this already. Yes there would be a powerful incentive to find the cheapest doctor which I see as something sorely missing today but the idea would be that no matter which one they choose the doctor still has to be properly qualified to do that procedure and so there would be a minimum standard of quality even if he chose the cheapest one. Note that under the current system that same cheapest doctor' is still operating and providing services to people they just don't know about it.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,diffused,t2_5f6y8,gt IMO the answer is testing and quarantine of people who are proven to have the virus. That is the answer and is exactly how South Korea stopped the virus almost instantly.

Less infected less deaths. It is not rocket science. I hope your ridiculous low estimates are correct but I live in reality. You should join us.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mc2222,t2_5nnka,yeah i think this is a big part of the issue. We're comparing different countries at different times in their pandemics. A big part of the impact is how overloaded a region's healthcare system is. NY is having a pretty hard time at the moment for example on par with other countries that have socialized healthcare. OP The issue is not socialized healthcare vs not socialized healthcare this is a global pandemic a once in a century event. it can overwhelm any healthcare system socialized or not. best not to draw too many conclusions of the differences between the two from black swan events.

Norovirus can live for a long ass time on the sand its unclear how long SARS CoV 2 can live on surfaces but most estimates put it at 2 3 days. It's possible that the Ocean Spray you feel at the beach could carry aerosol ized virus but I can't imagine that threat being any worse than any other outside activity. The biggest problem is just by leaving beaches open people will go there and crowd closer than they should touch shit sneeze on shit etc.

Most Americans understand that you still need a willing congress to do a lot of things as president. gt promised to repeal and replace Obamacare He repealed the individual mandate which is primarily what most people were upset about. gt promised to have Mexico pay for the wall. Literally no one who actually watched him speak thinks he would actually get Mexico to write us a check to build a wall. Only the fools who watch nothing but soundbites on MSNBC thought that s what would happen. In reality Trump got Mexico to deploy their national guard to stop illegal immigrants before they even get to our border. He s also renegotiated trade deals with mexico that will save billions. gt Meanwhile has spent more time golfing than any other POTUS ever Because the media counts every single time he s at Mar a Lago as a golfing trip even if he spends no time golfing. gt promised to eliminate the debt in 8 years Kinda hard to do that when congress keeps increasing the budget even after he proposes cuts. gt So what exactly has Trump actually done other than gaslight golf watch Fox News and hold rallies to pad his ego. Hm let s see.. New trade deals Stopped arming rebels in Syria Tax cuts Regulation cuts Job creation Lowering drug prices Record human trafficking arrests Welfare reform Prison reform Enforcing immigrating laws Cutting foreign aid Got other countries to increase NATO spending Government audits This is just what I can remember off the top of my head. Nothing is perfect and you may not agree with it. But continuing to ignore all of this and thinking all of middle America is stupid to like him for doing nothing and telling them what they want to hear isn t going to help you defeat Trump.

The reason we arent enslaved is because we have a more or less democratic government and a voluntary army that is made up of people from all over the country. We wont be enslaved because we would essentially have to vote for it. Also one of the main points of the 2A was to not have a large standing army because that was a major factor in the issue in Europe it had little or nothing to do with being a tool to prevent government tyranny by allowing some kind of active resistance. Yet I dont see too many pro 2A folks asking for the army to be dissolved back into state militias in order to avoid tyranny.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,RedDeadBilly,t2_3hc3zoer,Okay this seems to be not a troll so I am gonna lay this out as simple and straightforward as I can. What I know of Canada is that the country does not have a constitutional protection against the Government Passing a Law limiting certain forms of speech or even requiring it s citizens to say certain things. The difference between the US and Canada is that Canadian parliament passes a law banning or requiring speech as it would any law and this implies and I think they have the trust of the Canadian people to do that. If you want to do the same in the US we have two ways 1 Proposing an Amendment in Congress Write an amendment to be proposed by Congress. Secure two thirds majority support for the amendment. Introduce a joint resolution to propose the amendment. Debate the resolution. Pass a joint resolution in Congress. Using the Constitutional Convention Method Write an amendment to be proposed to state legislatures. Introduce a bill in the state legislature to call a constitutional convention. 2 Initiate a constitutional convention by the act of a state legislature. Consult constitutional law experts. Determine the parameters of the convention. Draft and approve the amendment in the convention. Ratifying an Amendment in State Legislatures Work with state legislators to secure support. Allow the States to consider the proposed amendment. Introduce resolutions in state legislatures to ratify the amendment. Pay attention to any time limits. Wait for three fourths of States to ratify the amendment. Ratifying an Amendment in State Conventions Call a ratifying convention in each state. Check state laws. Campaign for convention delegates. Build support in three fourths of the states. Enacting the Amendment Arrange a ceremonial signing of the amendment. Start adjusting federal and state laws to reflect the amendment. This will make the process take much time that the people here can use to research and debate. This prevents us from changing the constitution except in direst of need think slavery or at the height of stupidity think prohibition

A better question is how is your belief in government any different than other religious zealots
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Wark_Kweh,t2_c39mw,That isn't what I said nor is it what you originally said. I don't have a problem with government suggesting we listen to and practice what health authorities are saying. I am pointing out the difference between the government advising the public to conform to health practices and the government mandating conformity. And since people are behaving unsafely anyway even under local or wider government ordinances it really comes down to the people who are consiensious and considerate enough to follow those suggestions. It isn't naivety to point out that when everyone who cares is already acting accordingly big G mandates after the fact are hollow and they don't stop the people who are already disregarding those health advisories. The spread of this infection isn't something that can be stopped. Barring a vaccine the best we can do is slow it down so that fewer people are infected at once so or health organizations can keep up until enough of us are immune that our population as a whole is safe. So to your original point and the one to which I argued no governmental mandates aren't the most potent weapon we have against this virus. People are going to spread the infection regardless of governmental mandate. Everyone else is already doing what they can to slow it down.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,drsfmd,t2_9ba2h,I understand it perfectly well. You and the authors of that study are twisting the data. The public schools where I live are awful They have a 50 graduation rate.

What did you want him to say exactly The US will come to a standstill soon with the worst depression in history thousands if not millions will die and there is no telling when life will return to normal if it ever will. Next question please Is that what you wanted from the leader Is this your idea I genuinely believe that people like you hate our country. Every possible negative thing happened because of Trump. He asked to shut down travel from China. He was absolutely lambasted by the dickhead Democrats arguing with him today. I remember it. Then you have the audacity to argue he didn't do enough What would Pelosi have done differently Biden Bernie I'll tell you what is unpopular. He hates China. I hate China. I am tired of trying to work with a country that puts their people in concentration camps. A country that lets infected citizens travel around the globe to kill millions. A country that is founded on lying. A country so ass backwards that they boil dogs alive. Ban travel. Stop trading with brutal dictators. Stop being a mouthpiece for the CCP. It's unreal the amount of pro China everyone who hates China is racist crap on this website. Stop hating American freedom. People who share this crap are idiots. You are an idiot.

NEVER EVER EVER NEVER IN WORLD HISTORY has there ever been a recorded strain of this virus recorded by man. EVER. The virus itself CAUSES the COVID19 disease that pretty rapidly kills people. It is not the flu You purposely try to minimize it to spread lies propaganda misinformation. It IS called COVID19 and it is NOT the flu You need to understand that. They have NO IDEA if warmer temps will help fight COVID19. Fucking TRUMP is the idiot that said that. You will note that he was CORRECTED after he said that.

Oligarchs don t even pay workers enough to feed the landlords without multiple incomes.

Also the first argument I've heard that explains medical workers are buying into snake oil and being morons. So according to your information we should expect 1 to 2 percent of our medical workers to die pretty quickly now. Interesting. But you also seem to be saying they could save someone's life. So they should be sold at a markup to honorably save someone who is properly preparing. I don't know. Not sure what you are trying to say.

When is this insanity going to stop Based on the comments I've seen in here probably never because if it's for our own good then the government should be able to implement any restrictions they want and people will immediately come up with a justification for why they make sense after the fact even though they couldn't imagine one before.

That is a really stupid way to look at a virus that spreads incredibly fast and kills people fairly quickly. 1000 people in the US n just one day. Maybe you feel that this may be just natures eugenics and you don't mind seeing people die.... The stay at home orders are meant to limit our exposure. Its really really really easy to understand. All you haven to do is look at it. The less people out and about the easier it is to slow down the spread of the disease. Its all very simple. Th goal is not to keep people 6' apart. That's just a technique for when you HAVE to go into public to hopefully help slow the spread. To help reduce exposure when have to go out. No...what they mean is go the fuck home and stay there. If you don't need to be out you don't need to be out. People have to eat...that s why resturants and markets are open. Uber drivers deliver them to you limiting exposure. He is exposed you are not EXPOSURE LIMITED. THAT is the goal of the stay at home orders. Randomness There is nothing random about the order. You HAVE to eat. You are literally saying that if the govt REALLY was wanted to fight the virus we would ALL be locked up and only a few people would die of station and that's ok. Are you fucking drunk How do you expect somebody to answer to stupidity like that They aren't trying to starve people. AGAIN...its about LIMITING EXPOSURE.

The problem is also that his tweet is very easily taken as an attempt to trivialize COVID 19 compared to the common flu wtf is the common flu anyway gt He started his task force back in December. He didn't and the trumplings keep bitching that he couldn't start it because he was being impeached. Whic is it gt How is he not relying on the experts When he says stupid things and doesn't include the actual experts in his press conferences as he did earlier when he said stupid shit that contradicted what Fauci had already been saying. It wasn't until shit got real that Trump started acting serious about this and letting the experts come front and center. Until he started saying stupid shit like some scarves are better than masks. Don't you think Americans deserve better crisis leadership than this

Secondly it is now spring time and flu like viruses don't do well in these environments. At most some thousands of people could die of it like most flu like viruses kill. Japan numbers are very low. South Korea numbers very low. And Japan barely had any response to it. Completely screwing over the economy pushing millions into poverty could have much worse impact on health across the entire globe. This is a world wide shut down.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,vanulovesyou,t2_d0dh2,gt The leftists for their part are constantly surprised that when they ask for more government they don't get exactly the government they want.

After all the US constitution created a federal system that is meant to provide for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and this would include public health. While individuals have a role on battling against COVID 19 the state has a place as well in providing equipment that is beyond the capacity of the local level.

The Constitution does not define or describe any Libertarian philosophy you just like 3 words and ignore so many others establishing the very government you think is the devil. Liberty for all. I should have the liberty to work the land for it's value without somebody else trying to say they own it. You can't own the Earth. That you're such a fucking retard you think a denial of private property toward natural resources means you can't own a pair of Nikes is the second reason your being blocked. I'm terribly sorry you never actually have done any research into a political philosophy you're acting like an expert in. It's time for you to shut up and sit down.

He will not win the popular vote but he might be able to squeak out a victory again. He s a very clever little used car salesman isn t he I ll give him that. Most people aren t stupid enough to fall for it but juuuuuust enough do to keep him in business. What s important is that you know you Trump supporters aren t a majority by a long shot.

I know that I for one will never have less than several months of food on hand ever again. I think it has shown a lot of people just how fragile our supply lines are and how ready we need to be to care for ourselves. I've spent the last few weeks planting a large garden that I built in the backyard in raised beds. I don't expect to get much out of it this year in fact I expect to fuck up a lot. But I'll learn a lot and in future years we will be far more food sufficient than we have been in the past thanks to my hard work right now. I've also been focusing on acquiring more tools and I'm looking into a nice 3d printer so that I can be more self sufficient later this year will be solar panels and a rainwater collection system.

You have a right to life but not clean water food Those seem pretty necessary to survive. Right to liberty but not counsel fair judges and fair enforcement officers Those seem necessary in order to have justice. Right to pursuit of happiness but not healthcare Massive healthcare costs can have huge negative impacts that decrease your ability to pursue happiness.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Chrisc46,t2_ycno6,gt how do you decide which regulations are frivolous or over burdensome. I think the question should be pretty easy. Does it protect or infringe on natural rights For instance the prohibition of a drug that's not been tested is an infringement of one's right to association through voluntary trade and bodily autonomy. This regulation should be abolished. However selling that same drug by claiming it is a cure for an illness without verifiable proof is an act of fraud and is therefore a justifiable regulation.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Havetologintovote,t2_5o29y07s,gt You do hint at shutting everything down again in the fall and winter so we can tack 6 months onto your initial projection. The point of doing a good and proper job NOW is so that we're ready later and don't have to shut down again. It's like any job do it right or do it twice. But in this case it's the lives of many citizens and extreme economic damage that occur when you fuck up. We already fucked up. If we had started taking effective action in January we wouldn't have to take these measures now. But we didn't and it's far too late to stop the virus without taking strict measures now. Nobody is happy about shutting businesses and schools down but it's far far better than the alternative. I would implore you to consider is it wiser to take action early or late Does a wise man sacrifice now to protect his family later Or does he assume everything will be fine and just take his chances
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jemyr,t2_5hb10,So if the people who are saving lives aren't prepared enough it means it's responsible to sell at a markup to individuals and not sell at a smaller markup to hospitals because... we want more doctors exposed and dying to the virus to... teach them a lesson To teach others a lesson Because doctors who can intubate patients are less valuable than people who can pay more for a mask to protect their personal life Or maybe it's because the masks they should've had went elsewhere and that's so stupid other people have to sell them to the wrong people too.

It's a win for that doctor because he can attract more patients using pricing if he wants to. The doctor in your example just got a patent because presumably he was cheaper than another doctor. 2. It's a win for the patient because in addition to being treated he just got a small windfall to reward him for shopping around for the best price. 3. It's a win for government because it brings down the median price of the treatment over time which saves the government money

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,marks1995,t2_b9opj,I'll address this in two parts. First the list of things we do that kills hundreds of thousands of us every year is pretty long. Doctors will say don't drink excessively don't smoke don't vape don't drive fast get 30 minutes of exercise watch your fat intake etc. Most of us have decided we're going to take certain risks. And honestly the risk posed to the average person from this virus is pretty low. Not miniscule but low. As to the actual stay at home orders these are not quarantines. If this was truly an emergency and we need to quarantine that is a different issue. Some people are allowed to go to work. Everyone can go exercise go to the store go to a restaurant to pick up food uber eats drivers can go bouncing around between restaurants and houses all night every night etc. What we are doing isn't even close to a quarantine. What Fauci and the CDC want is for people to stray 6' apart. That's the goal of the shelter in place laws. And I have two issues with that. First people in rural areas don't need these laws to stay 6' apart. I think many of you have never truly been to a rural area before. And the states that don't have these rules in place are primarily rural. If the people are managing this issue on their own and their infection rates show they are doing fine why does the government need to interfere My second issue is the randomness of the orders. If you want to lock down people which is what many seem to want then lock it down. No going anywhere. You don't go to work you don't go to the grocery store no uber eats nothing. You can go 3 weeks without food. We would lose much fewer people from starvation than we would from the virus. I don't support this course but the randomly picking of the winners and losers is BS.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jemyr,t2_5hb10,So my language isn't or is dangerous your words and language is beyond reproach your belief that I said misinformation before is dangerous it's the doctors fault that they didn't buy masks other people need to take personal responsibility responsibility is not ensuring doctors have masks having the knowledge that doctors don't have the masks while intubating the patients and taking tests in an attempt to save other people's lives and dying themselves is something about personal inadequacy and telling others what to do plus you know how to not get ill with a viral supplement plan that all the sheep aren't using and you know the answer but aren't making a billion dollars educating us and selling it or maybe you have found some snake oil to sell and are jacking up that price too while expecting others to be idiots and believe you. I'm seeing a lot of language but no explanations about how the lack of masks doesn't kill doctors and how the best scenario is selling them to individuals at a markup as opposed to having them used at hospitals beyond your argument that resellers deserve to make money and their income should have priority. Personal responsibility in all of that is a very interesting argument I suppose we have a difference opinion about what the word responsibility means.

Scarves come in all shape and sizes and knit density think thread count At the very least he should have said.. if you don't have a mask still cover your face.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,r3dt4rget,t2_kesnx,One thing people fail to realize is that people who seek solitude like this by going out into nature aren't really alone. Example Many backpackers set off this time of year to hike the 2k mile Pacific Crest Trail or Appalachian Trail. You would think being alone hiking out in the wilderness would be isolating right Not really. People can't do these things alone. Not only are you walking from town to town but the park rangers and rescue teams are put at risk from you being out there. If you read the Facebook pages for these trails you see at least 2 recent events where a PCT hiker came down with a fever on trail and had to be rescued by the local town. So now you have a potential covid case in some remote town that should be isolated all because someone wanted to be out in the wilderness. In this case the guy was arrested for not listening to a life guard who now has to worry about getting exposed because some guy decides not to obey the stay at home order. It's one thing to do a low risk activity outside like going for a walk or visiting a park. It's another thing completely to venture out into the ocean or go on a wilderness hike. Had he just listened to the lifeguards he would have just been sent home no problem. But ignoring them and getting police involved with someone who isn't compliant I'm not surprised they actually charged him.

Both are not passing gargantuan spending bills paid by taxes or devaluing their money through loans The market is staying open and they allowed privately created tests to be made and picked which ones were working best to be more massively produced. Their respective versions of the CDC are using government money to help fund these and pay for the cleaning testing and quarantining of those who are positive for the virus. It costs them drastically less money results in an extremely slow spread and allows the market to be open so people can make money and not go into debt through the government. Both of these countries are so much better in their approach as compared to the US. In the US the answer to this is shutting down the market not letting people work 2 trillion dollar central planning bill and an overstuffed unemployment system.

Countries with socialized medicine have panels To determine who gets care and who doesn't There is only two ways to allocate scarce resources pricing or rationing. Ask a family of Charlie Gard or any of the elderly or immunocompromised during this pandemic in a country with socialized medicine how well rationing works out. Saying that somebody is not worth saving because you don't like their odds of survival is not compassionate. A friend of mine when I was a kid was in a car accident and was thrown from the vehicle. He had bleeding in his brain was in a coma and was mangled from head to toe. The doctor said there is a very slim chance that he survives and there's no chance that he ever wakes up from his coma. Stating that if his parents didn't pull the plug He would be a vegetable for the rest of his life. His mom couldnt bring her self to pull the plug on her child. Fast forward 20 years he's a father of two and owns a used car lot. He walks with a cane but that is the only remaining ailment from that accident. Medical professionals get it wrong all the time. When it's your family member whose life is on the line You better hope you have a choice in the matter. Because in a socialized medicine country he would have been dead at 15.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,rendrag099,t2_xopc4,gt How are countries with socialized medicine paying less per capita than the US If the US spent more per capita on entertainment than any other country on earth would that say anything about the quality of entertainment Would anyone argue that the government should step in and force entertainment providers to reduce their prices so that we spent less on entertainment Could spending per capita also simply be a measure of consumer preference I raise that comparison only to point out that spending per capita is a meaningless metric by itself. To answer your question we might be able to start to answer it by looking in reverse why could the US be spending more per capita than other countries on healthcare This is not an exhaustive list but consider the following people could consume more health services as a share of their overall spending because we lead less healthy lives than the people in other countries and require more ongoing maintenance. It could be because our current system of medical insurance is inefficient and leads to otherwise higher prices. It could be because we have greater medical capacity and can see more patients in a shorter amount of time. It could be because prescription drugs are more expensive here than in other countries. It could also be because we spend more money on end of life services than other countries. It could be because doctors call for more testing here than in other countries. I don't think it's adequate to simply look at spending and automatically say higher spending bad.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,myfingid,t2_u34eu,It's because the sub is flooded with progressive left individuals like the OP for some reason. IMO the answer is testing and quarantine of people who are proven to have the virus. There's nothing wrong with forcing someone shown to have a highly contagious disease to self quarantine in their home. The problem is when you tell everyone they cannot leave their homes something people are pushing more and more for. Unfortunately the opportunity to do this was blown when for whatever reason the CDC was the only people allowed to deal with testing and they fucked up their tests. It should not be hard to produce and distribute non evasive tests. All you need to do is ensure that they work. Don't need much more regulation than that. I believe a big part of the issue why many people are not taking this seriously is due to a lack of trust in our government and our media. When the government shows it self to be untrustworthy on a regular basis and when the media is screaming at the top of its lungs every day on every issue people just become conditioned to living in a world where everything is a top priority emergency.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Ed_Radley,t2_etyvw,I ll take this argument on from what I believe the true crux of the issue is from opponents of big government waste and rights. From a waste standpoint the argument is providing an allotment to people with no strings attached doesn t guarantee it will be spent on what it s intended. If there needs to be enforcement on how it s spent that s an added cost that s not necessary if people were left to their own devices in the first place. If the method of its disbursements made it impossible to be spent any other way it would ultimately create a black market where people who don t need or want grocery money will trade their portion for something they do want whether that s a different necessity or a vice. You still end up with people making bad decisions and people abusing the system to get more out of it than they deserve. From a rights standpoint this is ultimately the difficulty in supporting what s known as positive rights. Negative rights are a means of telling you what the government can t take from you or force you to do the ultimate negative rights in my opinion are the IX and X amendments to the constitution saying you can do anything not already expressly stated in the law as long as it doesn t infringe on the rights of others With positive rights I see two primary difficulties in enforcing them 1 by necessity they require the fruits of somebody else s labor for you to receive them and 2 it is very difficult to provide specific limits on positive rights. I ll give this as an example since we re talking about bare subsistence. Three things I think we can all agree are completely mandatory for the human condition are food clothing and shelter. You could argue healthcare or friends are also necessary but let s focus on just those first three. For you to be provided food there either needs to be government workers who force farmers to give up their land and take over production or the farmers need to produce food and accept whatever kind of payment the government provides which may not be enough for them to stay in business depending on the expenses they need to pay to stay in operation machinery land rent mortgage and property tax laborers maintenance costs insurance fuel seed etc The next issue is how do we determine the amount each citizen receives Does it take into account age digestive response allergies Crohn s disease target weight and complete nutritional profiles at micro and macronutrient levels What about local prices that would be factored in to cost of living This prevents a blanket dollar amount from working as not all locations have the same goods for the same cost and would require price ceilings which just creates shortages What about actual supply and demand You can t provide something to everyone if there isn t enough to go around. The same applies for clothing and shelter. Can a law take into account differences in body size and shape location cost of living supply type of event clothing is used for work sport formal casual material used for clothing spatial structural needs for housing and cost of production to ensure all citizens receive equivalent benefits without showing favoritism all while maintaining that no producers are robbed of value along the way The same situation from a negative rights perspective says you have the right to the means of your own production to do as you see fit to fulfill your own food clothing and shelter situation without the government telling you otherwise. To me it s never been about people becoming lazy it s about equality of opportunity and equal enforcement across the board. If you can t guarantee everyone is eating three course meals in silk pajamas from their oceanfront property while making sure the producers haven t been scammed in the process then is not a goal worth pursuing in my mind. On the other end giving people a set dollar amount for food basic plain clothes and a 400 square foot living quarters is shortsighted because it doesn t take into account a slew of living requirements for people with special needs which would ultimately require they be shown favoritism because they have greater needs requirement than others should they be provided and others who don t need additional benefits are left behind. Fairness is one of the biggest plagues on humanity because it necessitates compromises and by definition a compromise ensure both parties are not satisfied and the issue at hand will continue to be a problem due to the perceived sleight towards those involved not getting their way. This is why it is better to allow people to go after what they want with 100 of their capabilities and encourage but not require the successful or those with surplus to give generously to those in need. They already got theirs and are in a position to help. If they don t it s fine because they are the ones with the right to the fruits of their or their predecessor s labors.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,dumbwaeguk,t2_1779wl,That's not how this works. As I've said before there is no such thing as the free market and the government is not able to make a market unfree or to intervene in a market. We describe things that way to simplify it but such simplification is dangerous to thought. What the government can do is set additional inputs into the market equation. For example if you sell burgers and a shop opens down the street selling burgers is it intervening is it obstructing the free market No it is adding another input. When you calculate your potential profits you must now adjust your equation to include the effects of your competition. You might be inclined to think that accepting this the nature of the government's inputs are different and they really aren't You might feel like the government is putting a gun to your head but economics is a science and science doesn't care about your feelings. The government can set ceilings and floors but guess what So can private actors in any market. So long as the burger shop down the street is selling to at least one customer your sales are always going to have a ceiling of x minus at least 1. With this in mind saying it's the government's fault the free market can't help people in the pandemic is ridiculous. Jack Ma and the Chinese government found a way to help people overseas why can't businesses in the US Easy enough market capitalism is simply about seeking profits and these businesses don't see the potential to maximize profits by aiding covid victims. That's not to say that no business has stepped up in any way. For example Pornhub is offering free premium access. Obviously they're doing this because it helps their long term profit strategy. You know what doesn't inasmuch as their planning department has decided Taking some of their profits and spending it on n95 masks. The free market does not guarantee a comprehensive solution with or without government regulations. If private actors wanted to solve the problem they are free to find some way to do so. Some companies do a little bit while others do nothing. None of them are anywhere near maximum efficiency in approaching the problem so your but what about government restraints argument is perfectly irrelevant.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,PerpetualAscension,t2_16k8zg,Totalitarian regimes justify their existence by means of a philosophy of political monism according to which the state is God on earth unification under the heel of the divine state is salvation and all means to such unification however intrinsically wicked are right and may be used without scruple. This political monism leads in practice to excessive privilege and power for the few and oppression for the many to discontent at home and war abroad. But excessive privilege and power are standing temptations to pride greed vanity and cruelty oppression results in fear and envy war breeds hatred misery and despair. All such negative emotions are fatal to the spiritual life. Only the pure in heart and poor in spirit can come to the Knowledge of God. Hence the attempt to impose more unity upon societies then their individual members are ready for makes it psychologically almost impossible for those individuals to realize they are unity with the divine Ground of being and with one another.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,nowonderimstillawake,t2_opu58,gt As I see its what we eliminate is the profit from insurance companies can now be used for healthcare. Will probably have less employees and less paperwork and less negotiations. You can do this without going to a single payer government system. This is actually exactly how you would fix the healthcare system using a free market method. Get 3rd parties insurance companies out of the vast majority of transactions between patients and providers. Have health insurance actually function as insurance instead of functioning as a cost insulator as it does now. amp x200B gt Healthcare can't be linked to the job. Because then you can be stuck at a job you hate because you're afraid to lose your health insuranse... Or end up both jobless and without healthcare... This is a direct result of government intervention in the healthcare market. Look up the Stabilization Act of 1942. I completely agree health insurance should not be tied to employment because then you have large employers offering maybe 2 or 3 health insurance options to employees instead of having health insurers compete for individuals on the open market. If you were able to transition the country away from Copay Health Insurance Plans and more towards High Deductible Health Plans coupled with Health Savings Accounts you could free up the non emergency healthcare market to actually compete which would drive prices down.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DanBrino,t2_5q9669u,A mixture of government regulating areas that don't need to be regulated and allowing Shady practices in areas that probably should be regulated is how we got to this situation. The fact of the matter is since 1980 the government has increased its influence the most in three areas of American Life. Health Care housing and education. Not coincidentally the three areas of American life that have exploded in cost By magnitudes more than any other area of American life are health care housing and education.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Bruce_G,t2_7d6c6,gt Do you think that in a world where you don't have to earn your living there will be enough trash collectors and plumbers and electricians and carpenters 1. People don't hate the vast majority of work they hate the hours or their boss or the conditions or the pay. Take your example of carpenters plenty of people are happy to build or repair their own deck. The work itself carpentry isn't the problem. The problem is having to do it for 50 hours per week in a hot summer while not making as much as you'd like. If everyone's basic needs are guaranteed that has a ripple effect that reduces all those things people hate about their jobs. You don't work as many hours because you don't need to the pay being lower than you'd like no longer means the possibility of not making rent if your boss is a dick you can leave without worrying about being out on the street etc. You'd see people work less and pick jobs they enjoy more. 2. But what about garbage collectors and other jobs that almost no one really enjoys or even simply tolerates If there's work that's so universally undesirable it's wrong to give it all to poor people who have few other opportunities for low pay with the ultimatum take this shitty job or you'll be hungry and homeless. If no one is forced by financial circumstance to work those jobs to attract workers they'll have to increase pay switch to shorter shifts improve working conditions etc. Those shitty jobs would become less shitty and you'd find people who are willing to tolerate the work for extra pay.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,GShermit,t2_1yn7yk,I'm sorry you're annoyed that I concentrate on my social contract but yours is really none of my business.I Perhaps you have multiple political parties but we only have two viable parties. Our Libertarian party is full of nutjobs who make the philosophy of libertarianism sound stupid immature or contradictory. In America all we have to focus on is liberty for all and we the people using the Constitution take care of the rest. The fact that you're annoyed to the point of blocking just proves my point that the principle of liberty for all is unassailable...
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,FroTzeN12,t2_4v40wv94,Why do you have this premise Mutual self interest is not given at anytime since there is greed and other emotions. Having the ability to control or self reflect emotions is the way. Also the factor that if someone in jail is not a danger to society anymore should not be left out. I do not think that there is a way to prevent murder just to reduce the amount of it. The more layers of prevention you have the less it is likely to happen. The easiest way is to say that it is forbidden and that you end up in jail. A big factor is a profound belief system where every life is valuable the most You can not count on that on everybody. It would be great if every violent act could be fought just by throwing flowers at each other but for that to happen in everybodys belief system humanity needs to have proper mutual self interest. Self interest not by solely taking most to yourself.

Now the upside is that preventative care is better typically in those countries but that has no impact on catching a virus.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ThePiedPiperOfYou,t2_1le18sle,At a large enough scale you're a government. Look at the Belgian Congo for a real life example. If you literally cannot dig your own coal mine in the your yard due to the threat of violence then the company has become the government.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Boronthemoron,t2_lmon3,As you can probably tell I'm a bit more moderate than some other Libertarians I might even get downvoted by some so take what I say with a grain of salt. My rule of thumb is that if there's room for competition let the markets compete to provide for that service. If it's a natural monopoly eg. Infrastructure like a metro system then let the government handle it. Theres an important distinction to a lot of people on the left who would say that if it's a essential service let the government handle it. So yes for infrastructure let's not privstise that. But for healthcare education and shelter why not Why can't you look after a person's needs in those three areas by simply providing a UBI that was high enough Regarding your worry about school quality I think we could just make school performance more transparent so that shoppers have the information that they need to decide.

I am libertarian on most things but I do believe everyone deserves equal access to the same base level of healthcare at a price point they can manage. This would also be better for society overall and if we did it correctly our government would actually spend less money.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Chrisc46,t2_ycno6,I'm not sure that anyone questions whether or not a m4a system is provably better than out current system. It's unlikely though that any significant percentage of the population has even glanced at those studies and are only taking the word of someone else. That's true for both supporters and opponents of m4a. However the smart way isn't necessarily just settling for something that looks better on paper. The smart way is to look beyond the surface and address the future consequences of a decision. In my opinion opportunity cost economic incentive structure and the fallout on the globalized system are the biggest things that m4a proponents don't tend to address. These must ber considering when selecting the smartest option.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DublinCheezie,t2_tsofn9r,I believe what you are describing at least in theory is the public reward for companies and industries that provide positive externalities.

Imagine living in a company coal town and trying to start your own mine in your backyard. To your second question because services provided are also a choice.

They need to stop causing drama for everyone just because they don t like Trump. China s lies and mishandling of the Virus put the whole world at risk and the virus developed in China. China Virus makes sense to me. The malaria pills show promise as a treatment although they re in the process of being FDA approved for prescription. So Trump let the public know. The face masks stop you from sneezing and coughing respiratory droplets onto others and the CDC still recommends facial cover if you don t have masks. So Trump says a scarf will work which we have all seen. No one has proven scarfs are less effective than face masks.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Havetologintovote,t2_5o29y07s,The entire point of sheltering in place is to give our industry and health Care system time to ramp up and address the problem. The death rate of the virus rises dramatically when hospitals run out of beds ventilators and PPE. We also don't have a great grasp of what treatments are effective against the virus the shelter in place time period also allows that to be tested and rolled out. We need 5 8 weeks of everyone staying inside to make that happen. And not some piecemeal bullshit either the whole country. We can reopen when new cases are declining daily deaths are declining daily PPE has been sorted so there's enough to protect workers and eventually civilians emergency facilities and vents are available so when spikes happen we're ready ideally we have treatments that are effective this one is a big maybe This isn't the only round of flare ups of COVID we will see it will be back this fall and winter with a vengeance. We need to stop fucking around and take the time to prepare properly. If we do life can pretty much return to normal.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,blacktongue,t2_5fk4j,Thanks for the reply. Its possible for the government to effectively create a monopoly I suppose we see that in government contracts granted to corporations but the argument against that could be better government putting better restrictions on contracts and holding business to higher standards. But generally government was supposed to be a force against monopolies because they hurt the market. I see them as also hurting the individual. Just as there's no reason for government not to turn totalitarian without checks and balances there's nothing stopping an unchecked business from becoming a monopoly and no forces to reign it in once there.

Don't you care about those 200 000 people dying every year Why don't we implement a permanent police state and force everyone to stop these actions The original expert who predicted 2million US deaths causing this panic has admitted he was wrong. His new calculations would put us under 100k which sounds much more realistic. Plenty of other experts from places like Stanford and Oxford have similar predicions. This is still bad.

If something doesn't feel right and your PCM doesn't find anything. Get fucked. Your only other option is to go to the Emergency Room. And their job isn't to fix you it is to get you out of the bed ASAP. All of this is because the Government will decide who your doctor is based on where you live. And it is not going to be a good doctor either. It is gonna be a shit doctor because all financial incentives to being a doctor will be gone. So the really smart and good doctors will move to different things that can make money. Im ranting now and I am sorry but the Federal Government sucks at running EVERYTHING. I mean everything.

Brad has the Corona so when he went to the register he smeared the Coronavirus on the counter where John got infected. Luckily for Doctor John he had no side affects. Unfortunately Doctor Michele Grandma and the small child picked it up also. Doctor Michele got sick but was fine so was the small child however grandma is now sitting in the temporary installed mortuary waiting to be cremated.

It would be nice to see that statement inform government decision making more but the Declaration of Independence isn't actually law in the US. gt We have a right to sell our goods as we see fit when we aren't breaking the law. If someone will pay X on free accord nothing was gouged no one was harmed. No one was harmed true but no one was harmed when you list it as a high price either. When you list it at a high price its also someone paying X by their own decision. Both can violate the law because the laws are typically about selling at a price that is supposedly inflated or too high. Yes its stupid. And it could reasonably be considered extra stupid for auctions. But both auctions and selling at listed prices involve selling. gt the gouger panic will be a dark spot on our free market economy Yes I really wish the whole idea of price gouging would generally be considered a silly concept and the idea of passing laws against it be considered ridiculous and unjust. Unfortunately that is probably not going to happen any time soon. Even many people who usually strongly support the free market go against it in this area.

The amount of providers isnt very restricted you cant use it everywhere but even regular insurance has their own provider networks. So the choices arent that limited I think all the big hospitals accept it. For payment there is a schedule that is generally based on the lowest price negotiated by a private company with plenty of exceptions and caveats Private insurance is a complete substitute for Medicare. If you have private insurance the government does not pay for anything unless explicitly supplemental insurance which is generally just used for older people. So the incentives are still there the cheaper they can do the procedure the more money they get to keep. There are sometimes also penalties for patients that need to be readmitted so if they say they fixed something and got paid for it if you go back a week later with the same problem then they have to help you but might not get paid

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ILikeBumblebees,t2_3u3pr,gt It is not 100 owned by the government. It has privately owned shares of which the government owns a large portion. This is another example of politics describing things in ways that don't reflect what they really are The government issued common stock to the companies from which they acquired the assets that were used to form Amtrak. But despite being called common stock these shares are not traded on any exchange pay no dividends and confer no voting rights. That means they're not really shares of stock regardless of what they're called. The only stock that has voting rights and therefore functions as an actual ownership share is the preferred stock which is 100 in the hands of the federal government. gt This is also easily accessible in the Wikipedia article I referenced. The problem here is that you keep referring to articles that refer to what names things have been called by or what intentions people originally had for them and then citing that information as though it refute arguments that pertain to the observable behavior or qualities of the thing itself. This is equivalent to looking at a house that's observably been painted blue and then saying this Wikipedia article with a citation to a trusted source says that it's red gt They receive subsidies and market controls like many industries that otherwise would not be viable in their current forms. Take the coal industry or the farming landscape. And that makes these firms also arguably less than 100 private for profit businesses there are few libertarians that would argue that firms that depend on government subsidies to make ends meet can be regarded as truly private businesses operating in a free market. But the other characteristics ownership in the hands of the federal government establishment by statutory act directors appointed by the US president etc. make it much less ambiguous and make Amtrak quite clearly fall on the government institution rather than the private business side of the distinction. gt The combination of the mixed model and deliberate interference by political opposition created a worst case implementation. I don't think it really qualifies as a mixed model and the very fact that deliberate interference by political opposition is a factor in the way Amtrak operates in its own right i.e that its own managerial decisions are subject to political direction is yet another indication that it's really not managed like a private business I will absolutely agree however that Amtrak in it's current form is a worst case implementation.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Boronthemoron,t2_lmon3,Well I'm not from the US so my experience might different from yours. In my country we have a public system Medicare where the patient has no out of pocket expenses but has not much say in choice of doctor nor waiting time. This is different to my proposal. We also have a private hospital system and in that system the government will cover 75 of the scheduled fee and private health insurance if you have it will cover the remaining 25 of the scheduled fee. So for treatments costing below that value the patient has no incentive to shop around. This is different to my proposal as it removes and incentive for doctors to charge less than the scheduled fee. For treatments that are not completely covered by the scheduled fee a gap payment is required by the patient but sometimes the private health insurance will cover that too further removing the price signal It's also the case that sometimes all private treatment options available to the patient require a gap which is not the case for my proposal under which since it's the median price only half of the treatment options would be costlier than the reimbursement

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,GinchAnon,t2_nbgkfer,I wouldn't have thought going by the standard numbers would be that weird but ok. so KFF says USA has 243k cases overall with 5 900 deaths. CNN says 245. 6k w a little over 6k deaths. orldometers.info has the most comprehensive data listing 245. 4k cases 6 099 deaths in the US. it doesn't list hospitalizations but it does list serious critical cases. at 5 421 for the US. the part thats more bothersome is that they show 228 932 cases that are not yet resolved. people who are still sick who could possibly get worse. this article at the time 9pm April 2nd had almost 50k cases in NY. with a bit over 10. 5k hospitalized and 1500 dead. nypost.com from the above listed site the current numbers for New York specifically are 93k with 2. 5k dead. so 43k NEW people in the hospital in the last day and a half and 1k more dead presumably those are mostly from people who had been in the hospitals as they aren't talking about already being out of ventilators and they are seeming to manage to get people care when needed more often than not. New york having it the worse overall in the US but without having collapsed completely yet it seems abundantly clear at least to me that its NOT 2 of the hospitalized cases but rather that 15 20 needing inpatient hospital type care ratio seems to be holding and that a 2 of infected death rate seems to be holding pretty solidly. in fact compared to world numbers that rate seems to be LOW. EVEN IF we were to assume that theres somehow double the cases that we think there are because that many more people who have got it and recovered without having major symptoms... that would still mean that around 10 of those who get sick need hospitalized and 10 of those end up dying. thats still a huge deal at least IMO.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Raunchy_Potato,t2_4rfhr,Hahah fucking perfect. I love it. Of course you don't because you're a socialist piece of shit who will never be worth anything. But this is a fucking great letter. Democrats try to blame the situtation in New York on Trump He fires right back and lets them know they're responsible for their city. Democrats try to say Trump doesn't have a senior military officer in charge of this response He reminds them that he does. They criticize him for not using the DPA He reminds them he doesn't need to actually invoke it to get companies to comply. They criticize him for not starting sooner He reminds them that while he was starting the Coronavirus task force they were busy trying to impeach him in a partisan attempt to hold power. Honestly the only people this pisses off are statists and piece of shit tankies like you. So I hope he writes another 1 000 of these letters just so I can see your little meltdowns all over this subreddit. Get fucked you worthless scum.

If I know I have covid 19 and choose to go to the grocery store potentially infecting other people have I infringed on their rights by exercising my own rights Now what if I go to the store with the express intent to infect other people remotely ie touching things I think others will touch breathing near other people etc Is it just to refuse me entry based on perception or assumption alone
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,StickyRobot,t2_lmtg4,Not all companies are. Some of them are just laying workers off. My old trucking job isn't doing ANYTHING to compensate the employees and those employees deal with dozens of people each day. The majority of companies that are responding well seem to be low paying jobs like Home Depot and Walmart but frankly if those shit jobs paid a livable wage in the first place the idea of people taking two weeks of sick time wouldn't be such a big deal. The government is PAYING for sick time and giving low mid level earners a stimulus package. Many of these companies aren't giving sick leave out of the goodness of their hearts it's coming from your tax money. Regardless of Libertarian biases the government actions will help alleviate the financial strain a lot of people will deal with. Additionally the free Coronavirus testing will help a shit load for the many many Americans who can't afford a doctor's visit. Even with health insurance I would have to pay out of pocket to get tested otherwise rofl US healthcare system is trash.

They might become very driven criminals or have a condition that makes them dependant on others but there's no one around to take care of them or they need to take care of someone else so they don't have the time to work towards their personal goals or maybe they just die because of something stupid.

They want to improve their drugs not create new ones.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,IPredictAReddit,t2_8eny8,In a related article it was noted that there is currently a limited supply of the swabs themselves you need a very specific flexible kind to get far enough up the nose So every one of these likely to be botched at home tests is one fewer test a healthcare professional can administer. Some of the companies selling these tests have donated their swabs to point of care testing sites which is a good thing. The test is absolutely highly unlikely to be done correctly again have you seen what you have to do with it to get the right location usatoday.com swabbed It's long. Nobody at home is going to get that right. Between a rate of correct swabbing that is far from 100 and the type 1 and 2 error rate of the test the home test is probably no better than a random guess.

Taking a sample to help identify and quarantine an asymptomatic individual with no mask. So my language is what concerns you more Informing you of the reality we know to be true That not selling to hospitals is killing people specifically doctors And if those doctors quit even more of us die And your answer is those words are dangerous and follow them up with words about people looking in the mirror for preparedness. Those words are good words that have your approval to be said Looking in the mirror does not change the reality that people doing this selling know their actions kill people. They can chose to kill people or do the right thing. They chose to kill people because as we ve already learned one of them is pleased they have college tuition now for their kid a clearly better trade off for a dead doctor Let the free market decide the priority. When eBay and amazon removed this ability it meant these guys time was more efficiently spent wholesaling at a markup to the hospital as opposed to piecemeal selling to paranoid people. Dress it up how you like none of us can say we aren t aware of the truth some of us just want it said more quietly and wrapped up with a different bow of justification.

Also your example case is a more broad prohibition of large sudden price increases. It was a price control law more then a gouging law as they are normally understood I think courts have been kinder to laws only dealing with disaster or crisis situations then general price controls from states. Unconstitutionally vague Maybe some specific laws are but I don't think it would catch the majority of them. And both of those ideas to the extent they would have any impact would have an impact generally on gouging laws not just on auctions.

We just have different visions on how to achieve it. I agree that we should give people the financial breathing space so that they can take opportunities to educate themselves take risks with entrepreneurship and to not end up bankrupt from medical misfortunes. But I along with Hayek and Friedman think the best way to achieve this is via a vibrant and competing free market as well as a safety net rather than socialism defined as public ownership of the means of production Additionally the safety net that we want is minimal in three ways firstly it seeks to gives people a minimum floor to stand on as opposed to seeking to change inequality secondly we want the system to be minimal in terms of bueaurocratic administration and thirdly minimal in terms of market intervention or distortion. Therefore we would prefer a simple UBI as opposed to food stamps or social housing or minimum wage where the government centrally decides what is in everyone's interest.

He dismantled an agency designed to identify and prepare for epidemics ignored reports from healthcare official and his own military. And moved control of the federal stockpile from the CDC to a lobbyist who sold the supply to the first person who asked.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Otiac,t2_6q2mc,The public system is proven to be failing in multiple countries and has failed in many more countries. The private system has proven that it provides the best specialized care in the world and still provides care on par or better than public systems. Most public systems are proven failures when pitted against privatized systems. Great public healthcare not subsidized by private options is a fairy tale. The US alone spends 78 of the total R amp D money on healthcare and files half of the entire world's patents on healthcare thanks free market system for keeping me alive and figuring out new cures. Turns out healthcare is inelastic and making it a public commodity does nothing for anyone.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DavideBaldini,t2_oodal,I criticized you because you seemed to expand and add further constructions to the historical Locke's concept of property. And in fact I you claim that all existing land titles are invalid which is not a Lockean concept as he supported exclusive ownership of land and that any existing claim on land demand an ethical re evaluation due to scarcity. But scarcity is an arbitrarily defined concept while you may not find a free plot of land to farm in Manhattan two story brick houses finished and furnished with surrounding courtyard sell for 6 to 8 000 in rural Serbian villages due to nonexistent demand in the region. The italic joke of collectivization serves to point out that in absence of enforceable and predictable property rights on land capital investment spent on the land and the resulting development may be delayed or not happen at all in face of the risk that the land may be expropriated by dictate of government. And this coarsely resembles the endemic hindrance that afflicts capital investments in any communist society.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,natermer,t2_759z0,gt which is what Medicare Medicaid is. In Medicare it s not the government providing Health Care Nobody is saying that they believe that the government is the one actually physically carrying out the functions of doctors and nurses. They are objecting to the fact that when government pays for healthcare they use that money to attach massive amounts of restrictions and requirements that heavily fuck over the American public. Also single payer system would destroy what little pricing structure exists in the medical industry which would simultaneously and inevitably lead to both soaring costs and massive shortages. Here are only a few of the major problems 1. The USA Federal government is in bed with financial insurance and medical supply drug manufacturing industries. Industry insiders have a revolving door' in and out of government meaning that owners and representatives of these industries are the ones that set government policy and write the regulations that the politicians end up passing. This is natural and expected with large scale government as politicians are for the most part simply lawyers who have no understanding of medicine or related industries and depend on these corporations to inform them. Then on top of that you have corruption and payoffs that are rampant. This is called regulatory capture' en.wikipedia.org and is one of the major ways that the government is used by industry leaders to kill competition and increase costs. Wikipedia calls it a corruption' but it actually isn't because it's a important feature of how the government functions like it or not. 2. The medical system in the USA is too complicated to be centrally regulated. Even if the USA Federal government was 100 honest super intelligent and earnest in their approach it would still fail because of this and they are dishonest incompetent and slothful. There simply isn't enough good information and what exists does not reach regulators fast enough nor are they able to react fast enough for them to have the ability to make good decisions. This is the critical flaw in all large scale centrally regulated systems and is why Socialism when properly implemented always leads to economic failure. en.wikipedia.org 3. Price fixing leads to shortages. fee.org Price fixing is the only mechanism in which single payer' system can control costs. The only reason medicare medicaid is currently remotely functional is because it piggy backs on the market induced price signalling. They simply force hospitals to accept some fraction of market established prices and then forces the hospital to make up the shortfall by charging their other customer's inflated prices. This is why medicare medicaid for all fanboys can point to its cost savings' which can only exist if you completely and 100 ignore the fact that the general population not on medicare is forced to subsidize it. Force everybody on a single payer system and no longer do you have a ready population being exploited to subsidize the system and make it look like the system costs far less it actually does. This is why when you look at single payer systems proposed by Democrats they all would effectively bankrupt the country within months. And that is going by their numbers. Which means they no their plans are unsustainable and have no intention in actually implementing them as promised. Which means they are lying. Which is no big surprise because if politicians don't lie they suffocate. Every breath they take includes a lie on the exhale.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mc2222,t2_5nnka,There's long standing precedent for the government to issue orders to mitigate the spread of disease within its borders Source sacbee.com storylink cpy gt The law is clear the government has broad power in a public health emergency to take the steps needed to stop the spread of a communicable disease. In 1905 the Supreme Court declared Upon the principle of self defense of paramount necessity a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members. There is no right to put the health of others in danger and to act in a way that risks the collapse of our health care system. gt This is not a new principle. A few years after the end of the Revolutionary War Philadelphia was isolated to control the spread of yellow fever. By the time the Constitution was drafted and approved quarantine was already a well established form of public health regulation. States as part of their police power were deemed to have the authority to order quarantines to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. In 1926 the Supreme Court wrote it is well settled that a state in the exercise of its police power may establish quarantines against human beings or animals or plants. gt The court emphatically stated But the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good.

My local government allows startups and competitors but when the corporate cable company starts running promotions literally hijacking lines in litigation right now because it was proven so the other ISP gets throttled signing exclusive only deals with HOa's and propertry owners and more and more shady shit. Waiting for them to lose cash flow and then buying them out and shutting them down. But tell me once again how its all government regulation.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,FREAK21345,t2_we88u,gt This is absolutely not true. In anarchism you absolutely can have private property. If I hire a military to defend a plot of land and use it for my own gain what exactly is an anarchist going to do about it Again corporations can behave as states. Please reread this passage from my above comment assuming you read it in the first place gt Now you might say in the absence of a state you could just hire private security guards or something. However with no state to provide a police force there's not much there to stop those security guards from betraying you and violating what you view as your property. However you could certainly try to do this in a left libertarian anarchist society and it could work but it also might not work. There is no state there to stop that private military from betraying you. Also as I said the term private property implies there is a state involved. Please reread this gt Does this mean you can't own a house or run a small business in a left libertarian society Absolutely not. However your house and store are not your private property because the actual definition of private property is a legal designation for the ownership of property by non governmental legal entities. Notice the word legal Legal implies that there is a state involved. Capitalism requires a state. gt Things can be illegal without a state. Corporations and private organizations can govern and have rules. A I said terms like corporation and private organization imply that there is a state. But let's assum you are able to successfully form a large group that governs over an area. Guess what the term for that is A STATE.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Solinvictusbc,t2_fqzyn,Let me try to put it so simple a child can understand. There is only a certain amount of toilet paper being produced. Stores in your area can only order a certain amount of that. Let's say Walmart orders 1000 a week. They've set their prices to sell roughly 1000 a week based on demand. But now the demand has shot up drastically. Purchase limits don't work because people can shop around multiple stores on multiple days to get as many as they want. Meanwhile the honest person might need more than 1 but have to do without when purchase limits fail to keep it from selling out in two days still. There is a new price at which it will take about a week to sell out perfectly inline with a new shipment. It taking a week means everyone gets there same fair share as before. Obviously I can't tell you what price it might be but I know it won't be 80 a roll. And any increase in price also decreases the likely hood of people buying extra to price gouge higher.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,lobsterharmonica1667,t2_156o1o,The issue is how do you decide which regulations are frivolous or over burdensome. I imagine we all agree that we should get rid of the bad regulations but which ones are they. And while there certainly are some in my experience many of them are actually rather reasonable. I also dont see why it's a big deal for insurance companies to pay for preventive care. As you said it behooves them for you to take advantage of it so they might as well give you the incentive to go pay paying for it. It's also one of the cheaper aspects of healthcare. Lastly their isnt anything wrong about insurance also acting as a healthcare payment plan. It can often be easier and more efficient to simply make a monthly payment and not deal with any a la carte costs. For many people its easier to budget paying X per month than it is to save up in order to deal with unexpected medical costs even if they are only a few hundred bucks.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,The_Drider,t2_gs7ub,Tbh the optimal health care system is one that's universal but still privatized. That's what Switzerland has and what Obamacare was supposed to do before it was gutted IIRC and it makes for a great best of both worlds approach that even allows it to be partially socialized for people who truly can't afford it. Universality stops the free rider problem which is among the biggest reasons for the hilariously inflated medical service prices in the US. Plus since it means everyone has insurance there's a large entity behind everyone that is able to negotiate the prices down with much more purchasing power than an individual.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jemyr,t2_5hb10,This is an example of how central authority could save or be completely useless in a crisis. bloomberg.com Cuban has discovered that 3M has radically ramped up production but it has zero capability of controlling what happens to its masks when it hands them off to resellers who are selling to the highest bidder and flying them out of the country profit into their pocket not 3Ms so not helping to funnel money to the creation of more masks by the makers. Trump is not paying attention to the real problem so he thinks the DPA can be used to threaten them in a way to force them to make more or force their independent resellers to sell the way he wants. What he should do is send the National guard to the plants and take delivery directly and pay a 20 percent markup at delivery point as opposed to a 700 markup where it gets shipped to others anyway. Then he can allow the third parties to ship to other countries if he likes while he controls the masks. I have zero understanding why these mask logistics weren t figured out in February it is the first thing all the medical experts in my state said would be their major issue.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ObnoxiouslyPolitical,t2_3o3zfoup,gt I don't understand how. Many MANY reasons. gt Trump is probably the most liberal Republican president to serve. Technically all Republicans have always been liberal but let's dig deeper. Do you mean fiscally left or socially liberal Because fiscally he's definitely not. Eisenhower spent a lot of money and taxed at much higher rates making his fiscal policies the furthest left of Republicans that I know of. Socially Well that's harder to peg down simply because society as a whole moves in a general direction so you're comparing water at the top of a stream to water at the bottom. gt His administration didn't hesitate to roll out the most massive stimulus package ever rolled out by any president. The vast majority of which went to corporations a more right wing thing than left. Not to mention the 500billion dollar fund for corporations to use that can then be leveraged by Mulvaney to lend out 4 trillion dollars at his own discretion. gt I don't remember anyone else throwing anywhere close to the money out at people he is throwing out at people. Well yeah but only because his administration has COST people so much. You don't praise a kid for pissing on a garbage can fire they made. gt He hasn't made major cuts to social programs people assumed he would. He's floated it and probably would given a second term and knows that doing so would kill his reelection chances. gt And even on his most conservatives position of illegal immigration Obama at least after his first two years actually deported more immigrants than trump. Something that people like myself weren't super glad about. This isn't me saying illegal immigration is good it's me saying we need to really change how the laws work so we don't HAVE TO deport people as much gt On gun control be backed the bump stock ban which is more than any other Republican or democrat has gotten through on gun control. As president sure. Reagan however did more in the state of California. That said I'm not super into gun control myself not without definitive studies showing the effectiveness of the measures and potential side effects. gt Hes anti interventionist Except for how he's destroyed our tenuous peace with Iran and gave them a pathway to nukes. Not to mention how he's using our troops as mercenaries according to his own words. gt and has massively scaling back our influence in the middle east. Shifting troops from one place to another does not remove our influence it just allows Turkey to invade kill Kurds and release their captured ISIS fighters. gt He's with all other liberals and libertarians on being involved in senseless wars We're still in them though. gt and made clear in the Republican primary when being accused of being in favor of universal healthcare that his plan wouldn't allow people do die on the street. The only plan he even got close to signing would have kicked MORE people off healthcare so... gt His own words when the Republicans were saying he is for universal healthcare were call it what you want but I am not going to allow people to die in the street Dude's a liar dunno how else to express that really. gt They make him seem like he is the most right wing president ever and it's like what Based on what His fiscal policy which is the most right wing in decades.

Panic inducing price signals make panic buying more likely. This isn't hard. gt Will fewer people hoard if the price of a good rises It doesn't matter when we're talking about cheap stuff like toilet paper. As I explained above you don't have to make that much money to clean out a store that's price gouging toilet paper. Plenty of people can and will drop a few grand if they think the world's going tits up. Yes fewer people will hoard but it doesn't matter because it only takes a few hoarders to buy up the whole supply. gt Will companies be more motivated to produce said good I see you completely ignored my explanation of how increasing production due to panic buying is inefficient especially during a crisis.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Coldfriction,t2_127or4,None of the losses This is where capitalist idiots seem to think workers have no skin in the game and deserve no reward for their participation beyond subsistence wages. If the business fails the worst that happens to the owner is what They have to go become a worker for someone else. What is the worst that happens to the worker They starve lose their home and are forced into a worse situation than the owner as they don't have claim to any liquidated assets from the failed company. Contrary to what you've just stated the business owners want all of the winnings and imagine they're the only one's risking anything. They aren't Workers give their lives to their work just as the owners do. What you're saying is that a worker's life is less valuable than an owners. That is all you're saying. The carriers of risk in loan situations aren't the business owners they're the banks and lenders. When the business fails it declares bankruptcy and the guy who started it walks away in the same state he started in which is the same as an employee. The banks and lenders take the hit hot the guy who started the business. Risk brings rewards and failure but a worker takes as much risk in their life by missed opportunity costs when they sign on to work somewhere as a business man does when he starts a business. They both give time and neither gets it back. The business owner's time isn't more or less valuable than the employees. Should managerial work pay more than other kinds of work Most of the time yes. Should it pay orders of magnitude more Very rarely.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,NeverGiveUpMan,t2_h6ec9,Not sure how that works. They can of course make a law for anything. That doesn't mean it will hold up scrutiny when challenged on Constitutional grounds. If the act itself isn't gouging it cannot be called gouging whether or not they first do it call it that. Inflated also isn't inflated if another person chooses voluntarily to pay what they decided is fair. I think you're missing that the states regulated by the 14th amendment and their laws must accord it's just that states are given some latitude in health and safety to rule on their own. Here it looks like Maryland failed due to DCC. The appeals court held that Maryland's law overstepped limits on how states can regulate commerce specifically a constitutional ban on states controlling business that takes place outside their borders. The majority ruling argues that since most manufacturers of generic drugs and medication wholesalers engage in trade outside Maryland the state cannot control what prices they charge. npr.org So... since most manufacturers and wholesalers of masks engage in trade outside of state X the state cannot control what prices they charge.

Our courts aren't operating at full tilt so how do you propose giving these people due process before forcing them to never seek care. Also the flip side is all doctors take oaths to not deny care to people even if they are terrible criminals say. So you are going to have to seize direct control of all medical boards and force doctors to change their oath procedures ethics rules etc. And at this point now whose the people who think they know it all based on what they read on the internet Certainly seems like the guy calling on the government to sieze control of deciding who is worthy of medical care based on their actions.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Takashishifu,t2_38y0hy5z,It's pretty obvious I exposed all of you liberals on reddit for not having a basic understanding of economics. No wonder ya'll have the beliefs you do. Did people panic buy when there wasn't a panicky price signal from the store YES. Holy fuck you're going to ignore what's literally happening right now Will fewer people hoard if the price of a good rises Not saying prevent hoarding Yes Middle class people will not hoard 10 100 1000 rolls of toilet paper simply because fewer people can afford it. Will companies be more motivated to produce said good if they were able to charge more for it What do you think If companies could make 10 in profit per roll of toilet paper vs 50 wouldn't you think they'd divert more resources into making that good There are very very few instances when people interpret higher prices as higher demand and feel the need to hoard when they otherwise wouldn't Two of these instances are Giffen Goods and Veblen goods They apply in very rare circumstances. en.wikipedia.org For almost all products the demand curve has a negative slope as the price increases demand for the good decreases.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,PancakePenPal,t2_580ijb2j,Because it's not government intervention in the marketplace causing price inefficiencies it's government corruption and corporate intervention in politics causing issues. He's one of the candidate that better represented addressing those problems

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DakaZulu,t2_xjhyxui,While I understand your frustration and don't agree with price controls you are technically controlling the sale price of the item. You are changing the price as an owner and auctioneer to settle the bid dispute. They don't control the price at all. They just decide whether they will pay or not.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,nslinkns24,t2_3tfen797,That's fine. The important point is that disagreeing with a doctor over political policy isn't the same as disagreeing with medical advice. The two things have become conflated.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,IPredictAReddit,t2_8eny8,gt We should attempt once again to collectivize the farms and nationalize the ore mines Your inability to understand what Locke is saying does not mean he's wrong. His hand wavy means of justifying land ownership does not even apply when land becomes scarce I'm not proposing collectivizing a damn thing what I'm saying is that government authority to enforce deeds does not exist when land is scarce. If you don't like that take it up with Locke. Whether or not we acknowledge that no government had the authority to privatize the last of the commons would work or not work to your liking has nothing to do with a libertarian argument because libertarianism is not utilitarianism. Freedom is freedom whether it gets you to the end you want or not. If you want to make an argument that society works better if we just ignore individual's rights to the commons then feel free to do so but a libertarian subreddit is just about the dumbest place you can think of in which to do this.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,rendrag099,t2_xopc4,gt And on top of all that covid proves private doesn't work In order to argue that you'd have to show that the current system is private. It isn't In order for a new hospital to be built the builder must get a Certificate of Need from the State government which requires the existing hospitals to allow this new competitor to exist. Price gouging laws prevent prices from rising when there is a supply shock and therefore incentivizes hoarding of supplies and disincentivizes new supplies and suppliers from entering the market. Respirator manufacturers must jump through incredible hoops with the government to acquire permission be able to build that product which insulates those manufacturers from competition and does not allow other manufacturers to quickly shift production when there is a spike in demand. The CDC restricted testing in a number of ways and on top of it their test was inaccurate. FDA put up restrictions on test labs who could test the virus and how. I think if anything covid proves government doesn't work.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,tfowler11,t2_186vepjf,Already answered. It isn't for the feds but the courts have let the feds get away with a lot that isn't constitutional for them It is for the states. The states don't need specific powers granted by the constitution they just need a lack of a prohibition against the action in the constitution. You say its not the thing but gouging is not a thing in any objective sense. It defined by the states if the law calls it gouging it is. Many laws call selling items for inflated prices gouging. Not listing items for sale at inflated prices Yes its even sillier then normal to enforce anti gouging laws against an auction but silly doesn't equal unconstitutional.

FACT There is a virus that killed 1000 people in the US just yesterday. I haven't seen todays numbers but the prediction is that number will at last double by today. then double or triple tomorrow and again and again. FACT This virus can be spread human to human human to object object to human or by simply walking into a room with an infected person and breathing their air. FACT The best way known to fight this virus is to have no contact with others to halt the spread of it. The worlds leading experts have advised this. Being that we have nothing else to go on but what they tell us I will follow those orders. I don't want to contract the virus. I dont want to hurt anybody by giving the virus to them. IF you are that fucking stupid that you read an internet post and decide tht YOU are indeed an expert and that you know more than they do defy the order go out and contract the disease NO...you should not receive medical care. This is an unuasual emergency situation. YOU choose to defy the advice and orders. YOU contracted the disease. Now you can die infected and stupid.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,FLT8,t2_3kp5c5xj,Your point is somewhat valid but nobody wants to admit it. We are likely underestimating covid 19 infections by orders of magnitude. Statistically even with quarantining we should have tens of millions of cases in the US by now. But we are only testing people who appear very sick or who are sick with a known exposure. A high density metro area like NYC is likely to spread the virus a lot faster than in most cities and towns in the US. Though that doesn t change the fact that the virus is still overwhelming to the healthcare system and will likely do that at least to some degree in every city it touches.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jdauriemma,t2_jyeu0,Interesting pivot the original context of this thread is CMS not ACA. ACA is not the same as CMS at all and does not belong in a conversation about state provided and guaranteed insurance single payer. ACA did not significantly change how most Americans got their health insurance private employer provided insurance remains the norm and the federal government did not significantly expand its role as an insurer or payer. If you're looking for a defense of the ACA you won't get it from me. So once again you're taking a reform of the private insurance market and trying to use it to criticize a public insurance payer program in the model of CMS. Apples to oranges. Yet again you fail to acknowledge the elephant in the room the USA pays the most in the world for health care and provides mediocre care for our population.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,fuzznutz77,t2_2ohq0n2c,Agreed. These numbers are wildly skewed. I believe the value to human life has been roughly calculated at 1M per person. As to the death rate we will never know the true mortality rate unless we test everyone and test for antibodies in exposed people. I have been watching the numbers in TX 10 of people that get tested test positive. Those are symptomatic people and most likely exposed healthcare workers. As we review the death rate in Italy we see a huge bias in the deaths of people skewed to the extremely elderly and people in poor health. A median age of 79 and 75 of the dying had 2 or more co morbidities. If a person in a hospital was dying of cancer and tested positive what was the cause of death listed as If the idiots in Washington want to reopen the country the smart thing is to test everyone as fast as we can. Then set some metrics for risk. 5 50 year olds with no health issues you have a 99. 5 chance of surviving this get back to your lives and then set sliding scales as you go up. This fear and panic is just insane.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ThePiedPiperOfYou,t2_1le18sle,The problem is that you're talking about the nebulous topic of price gouging' vs. the actual statutes in place. For instance CA's price gouging law Penal Code Section 396 states it is unlawful for a person contractor business or other entity to sell or offer to sell any consumer goods or services including rental housing for a price more than 10 percent above the price charged by that person for those goods or services immediately prior to the proclamation or declaration of emergency CA's law doesn't care how the price was raised in a declared emergency. That the sale happened at the raised price invokes the law. How this applies to a first time seller in an auction situation I have no idea but it is the sale that matters not who bid up the price.

You used a fraction of a percent of the population of of the population to use as an example agian using emotion to cloud your judgment. American's give roughly 410 billion dollars a year to charity. That's more than the total assets of the top 4 billionaires in the world. That just counts for the official charity thats reported to the IRS.

Very very few people have died that were otherwise strong and healthy. 10 million jobs lost is just over a week in.

Instead of everyone staying home there could be just a small percentage of people staying home that 1. 5 that is at high risk.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Bruce_G,t2_7d6c6,gt FEWER people would hoard simply because fewer people can afford to hoard When we're talking about basic goods Nope. People may interpret higher prices as higher demand and feel the need to hoard when they otherwise wouldn't And with basic goods many people can buy out the store even at 10 roll we're not talking about some colossal amount of money here. gt Not price gouging means a metric fuck ton of people will hoard Or they don't panic buy because they're not getting a panicky price signal from the store. The only surefire way to prevent hoarding is rationing price gouging just lets rich people blow money and poor people struggle to cover the costs of the basics. gt I m going to be more motivated to produce toilet paper if my profits are 10 per roll We don't need more toilet paper today than we did two months ago. We need about the same supply we just need everyone to have at least some. What you're describing is a natural market inefficiency diverting production resources during a crisis to produce unneeded goods to meet the demand of panic buying. gt Where are your studies or science behind what you say I must have missed yours.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,nowonderimstillawake,t2_opu58,This is the point so many people get wrong thank you for saying it. People who want a single payer system come in and say We've already tried it the free market way and it's a mess now we need to go single payer No we have not even come close to trying a free market healthcare system in the U.S It has been damaged by government interference and regulation since the Stabilization Act of 1942 which caused the vast majority of private healthcare to be tied to employment.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,rondopro9,t2_tqija,added a couple if you need me to verify anything else let me know. I did a research project in undergrad comparing the systems and trying to figure out which systems allow some semblance of a free market to work. The big problem with the ACA is it's not an ideal marketplace because ultimatley majority 90 of the insured get their healtcare through their employers. This is in contrast with Switzerland where every citizen is in the marketplace and are active forces. The order of price inflation is vastly lower as a result.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mrglass8,t2_leftm,I hate that solution If i'm standing next to you and I keep poking you and you ask me to stop You can move is not an acceptable response.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,joshsteimle,t2_ocrti,I think I may have figured it out. Over the past 20 years the government has taxed my business. I regard that taxation as theft. If the government said We're going to give you that money back I would have no problem with that. You could make the case that I not only deserve that money but interest as well and perhaps a high rate of interest given that it was involuntarily loaned to the government. What I have a problem with is getting more back than that amount. Here's where I am struggling to think through things Payroll taxes While these are paid by the company they're on behalf of employees. The govt could require employees to pay it directly but they have companies do it because it's easier to enforce compliance and it adds a layer of obfuscation to the process that is it makes employees not notice so much the money being taken from them vs. if they had to send in the money themselves. If they are being paid by the employees not the company then it is the employees who have suffered damages not the company. However the money being given through the CARES Act is explicitly to cover payroll and maintain the employment of employees. Therefore while the company is receiving the funds from the government it is doing so on behalf of the employees it has. In that case it would perhaps be justified for a business to accept as much as all its employees have ever paid in taxes during their working lifetimes. That amount in many if not most if not all cases is likely to exceed the amount of the loans that will be given. Therefore taking the loan is merely restoring to those who have been robbed what was taken from them as though the taxation had never taken place. The reason I didn't look at things this way before was because I was only looking at the taxes I or the business have paid in the past and that lacked proportionality that is the amount we would receive from the CARES Act is likely greater than the amount I and the business have paid in income taxes it's pretty easy to get rid of business income taxes you just lose a bunch of money for a few years that you then write off in later years However when you look at the business as a vehicle to restore the stolen taxes to employees to compensate them for what they've lost in the past then this merely moves things towards conditions that should have existed in the first place i.e no taxes. Am I missing anything here

Having the price go up because of reduced supply or increased demand due to a disaster is a feature not a bug. If you caused the disaster to take advantage of higher prices then you did something wrong but even then it wouldn't be gouging that was wrong it would be causing the disaster.

You just don't pay to help build or run the library. You also don't get the benefits of having a library because you don't pay for it. Ok question where did you get the term mutualism Mutualism has nothing to do with what you described. Literally. Mutualism as an political ideology that started in the mid 19th century started with the often cited quote Property is theft Mutualism thinks that owning property is an theft from society and earning income via ownership of private property on means of production land or money as mutualism is opposed to an profit driven banking system Rather than property rights occupation and use must dictate ownership according to mutualism. If you use a thing you own it for the duration of its use. If you occupy a building it is yours to use atleast the space that is activly occupied by you. If you move to an different house you can no longer claim ownership over that house and can't claim rent from those that will occupy the building after you. Same goes for factories land and so on Those that occupy it own it. Meaning it is socialist since it demands work place democracy.

It is also very difficult to assess the lethality of the virus relative to previously known types of flu and colds. To date COVID 19 deaths in the US are far fewer than deaths in ordinary flu seasons or from past pandemics such as the H1N1 virus.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HUNDmiau,t2_y9bcf,gt the government is not optional Neither is buisness as a whole I can't say no to buisness I can just choose which buisness. And well that is also true for government I can decide which government I want by leaving and moving around. It doesn't free me from governments but I can choose which one I want. gt they have military and police with guns and prisons at their disposal if people do not follow their rules They usually use these to enforce the desires and wishes of buisnesses. gt Big government deeply involved in citizens daily lives people have no choice but reliance on gov so maximum control Small government takes care of the big stuff like security roads etc but favors the individual's FREEDOM to make their own choices raise their kids make a living etc Every government is thus deeply involved in my life and a small government doesn't exist within structures of profit driven economies or states.

If they were to only pay what medicare pays now which can be as little as 25 of what private insurance pays doctors private businesses won't be able to function and the state will have to take over that part of the industry as well. If you want to talk about medicare for all you need to talk about VA for all because that what we will get.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,MizchiefKilz,t2_xa0am,I recently learned about CON laws ncsl.org ncsl.org gt Certificate of Need CON laws are state regulatory mechanisms for establishing or expanding health care facilities and services in a given area. In a state with a CON program a state health planning agency must approve major capital expenditures for certain health care facilities. CON programs aim to control health care costs by restricting duplicative services and determining whether new capital expenditures meet a community need. This is why we don't have any extra capacity in times of crisis. And yes by control costs they mean not making costs too low by having too much competition.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,BriefingScree,t2_147g3w,That is BS since plenty of businesses operate on razor thin margins. And finding ways to reduce costs is how we improve the efficiency of care far less incentive in the public system. Doctors and nurses have engaged in sufficient cartel activity to ensure they are horribly over trained for many tasks but cannot be substituted. Mostly through licensing regulation.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Chrisc46,t2_ycno6,gt Violently imposing absentee hierarchy isnt voluntary Correct. If one breaks an employment contract the other has no right to enforce that contract through violent means. One can however defend their property from aggression. As an example if you voluntarily agree to work for an absentee employer then assume controlling authority over the production you've violated your contract. The owner cannot use force to then make you work for him again but he can defend his property by having you leave as you have become an aggressor. gt You're a real dipshit. Ad hominem attacks are a sign of argumentative weakness. They tend to have the opposite effect of the one intended by diminishing the character and credibility of the accuser instead of the accused as they imply that one has no further arguments and is therefore resulting to insults. You should have noticed by now that I have not insulted you during our conversation as you have in nearly every response. I have zero desire to impose harm on others mental or physical. You on the other hand are perfectly willing to be an aggressor which isn't surprising given your desire to forcefully restrict voluntary interpersonal interaction.

The oil industry is subject to much speculation with regards to price gouging. thelawdictionary.org Price gouging is retailers increasing price in the absence of supply. If you start the product off at below fair market value how on earth can anyone say that you are price gouging. It's up to the bidders to decide the fair market price. Even more people who had masks from before the virus had no part to play even in the shortage. How is that in any way price gouging

If no steps are taken to flatten the curve medical facilities are going to become overwhelmed and then people who normally would be able to survive with treatment now start dropping like flies and that mortality rate is going to skyrocket.

Trump is probably the most liberal Republican president to serve. His administration didn't hesitate to roll out the most massive stimulus package ever rolled out by any president. I don't remember anyone else throwing anywhere close to the money out at people he is throwing out at people. He hasn't made major cuts to social programs people assumed he would. And even on his most conservatives position of illegal immigration Obama at least after his first two years actually deported more immigrants than trump. On gun control be backed the bump stock ban which is more than any other Republican or democrat has gotten through on gun control. Hes anti interventionist and has massively scaling back our influence in the middle east. He's with all other liberals and libertarians on being involved in senseless wars and made clear in the Republican primary when being accused of being in favor of universal healthcare that his plan wouldn't allow people do die on the street. His own words when the Republicans were saying he is for universal healthcare were call it what you want but I am not going to allow people to die in the street So I fail to understand how he is not generally more liberal than any other conservative. I really dont. Anyone saying he isn't is clearly manipulating you. They make him seem like he is the most right wing president ever and it's like what Based on what Lol. Seriously how can people even pretend he is and get people to believe them when saying he is But they do. They are clever at brainwashing people into thinking he is something he is clearly not. Its really not hard to see.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,boxdude,t2_9c54r,Go read Hayeks book The Fatal Conceit The Errors of Socialism. You can read it free here semanticscholar.org 3A The Errors of Socialism Hardin Hayek d40480a667b0d2a63162a431bdd757d7ee8afc79 TLDR The economy is an emergent system. No one has perfect information and no one knows everyone else's needs with certainty. Prices in a free market are the best device we have for aggregating that emergent knowledge and using it efficiently to determine resource allocation. Central Planning under socialism removes the knowledge transfer property of prices and brings the system to a grinding halt with bad consequences. Thus the fatal conceit of the socialist is the thinking that they know better how to run an emergent system than private individual actors acting independently. And to your other point libertarians are not pro corporatism. Sticking with Hayek all you are doing in a corporatist system is handing central planning power to corporations who rent seek through government power. It's a different form of Central Planning but just as bad.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,rchive,t2_y9jp1,The aspect that's a bit like a public good is that national parks are often home to herds flocks of wildlife and certain kinds of wildlife are often seen as a public good. I think most people think of parks as places people go to see nature or go camping and those aspects are absolutely not a public good. You may know this but a public good is a good that is non rivalrous and non excludable meaning that any number of people can make use of it at the same time without reducing the usability of it and that it's not possible to keep people who don't pay for it from using it. Parks as recreation places are neither of these. If you put a million people in Yellowstone at the same time it would be a disaster and the park has border you could build a wall around if you wanted to. Wildlife is harder to exclude people from since animals don't know about property lines and they just go wherever they want. The use of an animal specifically is probably rivalrous but one use is taking pictures of animals and a picture can be shared infinitely without degrading the animal as a resource so there's maybe some element of non rivalrousness as well. It's a bit squishy. The main point is that healthcare very much has neither element of a public good so arguments for other government services don't actually apply to it easily.

That won't get any better if you expand Medicare from 44 million to 330 million. Most of all federal spending goes to just Medicare and Medicaid as it is. Medicare for all would consume the federal budget several times over. And that amount of money doesn't exist.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,chunkosauruswrex,t2_ben61,No the point is that having universal healthcare is not some magic bullet that makes things work better.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Get_Wrecked01,t2_4c0lvsk6,Of course it's worse. I've not suggested anything to the contrary. I know my risk I've done my research and there is no science that says a well controlled diabetic is any more at risk than anyone else. Risk assessment for diabetes has to take into account level of control insulin dependence and how far along into the disease one is. The studies simply say diabetes may be a risk factor. Given that my a1c has tracked between 5. 2 and 5. 6 for the past 6 months which is essentially normal according to two of my doctor's and I have no other complications no high blood pressure high cholesterol kidney function issues etc I'm not super worried. Overweight people are more likely to have diabetes hypertension and other issues that affect immune system cardiovascular system and lung capacity. Every actual study I've seen and they're have been a lot of them bundle comorbidities together. Not research has been done to gauge risk factor by comorbidity. So it's not clear if being overweight by itself changes the risk much. There are tons of anecdotes but anecdotes aren't science. If I got all worked up over every anecdote I came across I'd be a nervous wreck. If you've seen a study that quantifies risk more granularly I'd be very interested in seeing it. Regardless there is nothing I can do expect stay inside away from people which I've been doing for 4 weeks now. I may still catch it on a necessary grocery run but other take the necessary prevention stuff what am supposed to do Freaking out isn't helpful and it point of fact will raise my cortisol level and their my blood sugar out of wack.

It is not 100 owned by the government. It has privately owned shares of which the government owns a large portion. This is also easily accessible in the Wikipedia article I referenced. Their operating expenses are not paid by the government. They receive subsidies and market controls like many industries that otherwise would not be viable in their current forms. Take the coal industry or the farming landscape. Overall the more widely accepted take of their failings was characterized by the comment you replied to.

If you consider activities that have for sole purpose self fulfilment and personal development enjoyment as productivity which many leftist tend to do then I'm sure people would be very productive. If you are a bit more realist and define productivity as the production of goods or service that have an economic value then I'm extremely sceptical.

Should society have equity or equality from the government or the community and realistically in my opinion trying to force everyone to have the exact same amount of wealth without building values in society compassion kindness spirituality respect you can only get a society where most become poor and hate everything about the society.

All you do is list a single libertarian philosopher and pull the classic conservative go do your research 4. When pressed for specific examples you still stubbornly refuse to give specific examples 5. Thus the fact that you are so unwilling to give a single specific example can only lead me to believe that there must be some ulterior motive why. And I can only assume it s because you don t actually have any specific examples you don t want to risk contradicting yourself or getting called out next time you re ranting about taxation being theft.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,delmecca,t2_118n0f,Do corporate welware to enrich positions is fair come on I dont believe in any subsidies.I have owned two small business in my lifetime neither have received bailouts. I paid good wages plus a 5 percent commission on any large orders that would benefit my employees they had some sort of healthcare paid for by me. I worked a job to substitute my own income but my business was self sustaining people let's get real its not capitalism if you aren't capitalized enough to pay your own bills and choose to sustain your employees. In a free market society there would be some sort of insurance to help businesses stay afloat and a benefit they could offer their employees so they can keep them on the payroll. We ship everything to this country from China even medical supplies and now people are dying. I have been telling people that there is no economy if there is no manufacturing base technology and automation will kill alot of intellectual jobs like accounting financial advisors etc all you have to do is put an algorithm together and boom a job is gone. We can't bailout these companies out they have been taking out loans to do stock by backs. The stock market has crashed and assets are now back to where they should have been. Innovation is what keeps companies profitable.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,rondopro9,t2_tqija,yup it just won't work in the US because switzerland is 1 smaller country with more population density than the US makes healtcare cheaper to provide 2 Swiss citzens are richer on average by almost 20 30K on average so the increased premiums switzerland is one of the more expensive healthcare systems in Europe are less of a burden relative to what an average American would face. They are also able to afford 3 Switzerland has much lower levels of income inequality. So not only are the swiss richer they have less poverty as well placing less of a burden on the mandatory public option. 4 Switzerland is a much healthier population overall with a lower rate of chronic diseases arguably the most expensive care to provide than the US 5 Government is way more democratic and extremely responsive to changes. Their government imo is one of the best in the west. Their system of governance and high citizen participation in their political process help keep unnecessary regulations to a minimum gt Allowing for the free market to actually work in improving service Switzerland has the highest density of nurses and their professionals are paid some of the best wages

If we didn't make the test free then people would refuse to get them. You can argue the government should foot the bill for testing given this is a pandemic and it s a national defense issue. However people should pay for their own care if they get sick. Your medical bills are not my responsibility. gt That is only one example of how a private healthcare system fails us during a crisis. There are problem that can't be solved by businesses kid. The sooner you figure that out the better off you will be. I fail to see how the private healthcare system is failing us here when it s actually helping. Private hospitals are running and have access to capital. Companies are ramping up production of all medical supplies because prices are high. Italy can t scale like we can because their system is a government controlled socialist mess with no working price signals. Oh yeah and the one shining example of government run assistance That medical ship with 1000 beds It s practically empty because of government incompetence. Stop peddling your socialist healthcare crap on r libertarian. I thought we finally got rid of all the moron Bernie supporters when his campaign predictably collapsed. America doesn t want the government running its healthcare system.

When assigning a monetary amount to a human life one factors in age and earning potential. A young medical school student is assigned a much higher number than a 95 year old dimensia patient. The former may be assigned 9 million in value but there is no way that the later example would be assigned any where close to 9 million. The coronavirus mortality risk is falling much higher on old people. There is simply no way that your 58 trillion number is even in the ballpark of being correct.

Another reason why libertarians are a fucking joke they piss and moan yet put zero effort into understanding what they're pissing and moaning about. Did you try reading the damn order gt Further violation of an emergency Executive Order is also a Class A misdemeanor under Tenn. Code Ann. 58 2 120... gt Enforcement measures should be used as a last and final option only if they become necessary due to a refusal to voluntarily comply after all other reasonable means have been exhausted. There's your answer. A violation is a misdemeanor and they give you the code section if you want to educate yourself about the penalties for that. There's also a mandate to ask for voluntary cooperation first and only enforce the order as a last and final option. But go back to your hysterics about cAn ThE cOp ShOoT mE oN sIgHt the other 95 of the country will continue writing libertarians off as usual.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,valmeister,t2_5g403,Yes I have a right to own a weapon. Because that does not require work from anyone else. It just means I can own it. If I have a right to healthcare that means someone must do work for me to have that right regardless of their willingness. That's called slavery and not something I'm ok with. Rights are free. All they require is the goverment to leave me alone. If the goverment collapsed id still have my rights. Healthcare can't be a right because it requires the efforts of someone else. If they all refuse to treat you then that should be ok. You are not entitled to others work

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Bruce_G,t2_7d6c6,gt If everyone was as well off in this regard as these people where would that go wrong One common argument is that if everyone has their basic needs guaranteed some people perhaps too many people would simply check out of society and spend their days playing video games and living on the dole. This is a poor argument for a few reasons 1. If the concern is that so many people would loaf that the whole system would come crashing down for want of productivity you can tie fulfillment of basic needs to a job guarantee. 2. Most people aren't content having only their basic needs met. Most people want at least a little more so they would still have an incentive to seek work with more compensation. 3. Most people aren't opposed to any and all work on principle they're opposed to shitty hours shitty conditions shitty bosses and shitty pay. If everyone's basic needs are met employers can't treat workers like garbage and workers aren't forced by necessity to stick around in bad jobs. 3. Many people if not the vast majority of people have work they would like to do but that economic conditions make it difficult to do. The economic concerns that dissuade people from pursuing the type of work they would really like can be largely resolved by guaranteeing everyone's basic needs. You might hesitate to start that business you've always thought about if failure means you lose the roof over your head if that's not a concern anymore suddenly you're more free to take that risk. 4. If there's some small segment of society that will always just want to loaf and do no work they're still human beings and should not go homeless or hungry in the richest country in the history of the planet. Supporting a few people who at least for now refuse to work is well worth the cost in this scenario as it a would greatly expand everyone's effective freedom and b would be a major step towards a society that adequately values human life.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,drinkonlyscotch,t2_39jaw,Liquidation is not only unnecessary but it would also result in adverse consequences. People might run for office just as a means to get out bad investments without raising eyebrows for one thing. Some legitimately good and qualified people might never run because they don t want to give up on their retirement before it s had a chance to mature for another. Also you re basically saying that nobody with a spouse who has any sort of equity compensation would be able to run. That s a lot of people. It s not just c level execs who have equity options. In some sectors like tech it s extremely common. And as I said it s not needed. Instead of liquidation I would say assets could be put under the control of a special brokerage who basically freezes them makes no trades and issues monthly disclosure reports. Upon leaving office asset management can be reassigned to another firm or the politician themselves.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,GinchAnon,t2_nbgkfer,I think that's a reasonable way to feel and IMO that's why the president's actions are all over the map. Swinging between this is terrible and will only get worse if people freak out so better candy coat it to then taking dramatic action. But then pulling the punch because it would freak people out and he's not sure it merits THAT hard of a hit. I think it might BE in the middle where it's hard to predictively justify going all out martial law police state even for a short time... While being bad enough that it kinda feels like maybe it would have been better in retrospect. It's like... The authoritarian solution is more effective. That's hard to deny. But where is the balance point I'm not sure there is a good answer. Maybe it's easy for me to say. I have a job that would likely still exist even if we went full police state and had state distributed food allocations delivered. Food infrastructure
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Boronthemoron,t2_lmon3,I think it's a good question. I've been reading up on welfare recently but I'm not an expert. Just setting the scene a bit I think there are different flavours of libertarians with different emphasis. On one side you have those who emphasises seeing people as utility seekers and whose focus is on the efficiency of markets and who might care more about poverty Frederick Hayek Milton Friedman This is the group I belong to. On the other side you have those who are a bit more hardcore and whose focus is on private property as natural rights that must not be violated as they see it as immoral these people are more hostile towards welfare Murray Rothbard Ayn Rand I just wanted to understand your position more first why do you want to provide welfare in the first place Are you seeking to lift up the poor because you want to reduce their suffering Or is it out of a sense of equality egalitarianism Since the answer will differ greatly depending on your emphasis..
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Drippinice,t2_38bibwwf,Ok I know the facts. Anyone reading this can do a cursory google search and see that you re wrong. You have to get a license to support a state owned broadcaster ffs
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,wiresequences,t2_11msce,That's higher up Maslow's hierarchy of needs than the basics like food shelter and safety. Maybe should have clarified but you don't have to imagine a fantasy world look at elites in most societies they take care of each other so that no one has to individually take care of their own food and shelter. It's the needs higher up that hierarchy of needs that they can individually pursue.

Contrast that with the comedian from Canada and all it took was one single individual making a claim against him simply because the victim was disabled and he gets slammed with that punishment. No Canada does not have true freedom of speech. You may call it that but it is not the same as what we here in America enjoy. Don t misread me I have nothing against Canada I just disagree with you.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,hahainternet,t2_3zdkk,gt No there literally aren't Our police don't celebrate recovering broken safety scissors and garden tools when preforming weapons sweeps.

In a perfect world discussions seem like a waste of time. I believe that greed is a better motivator than casual kindness.

To be so blatantly unaware shows a lack of situational awareness unbefitting a presidential candidate. Nowhere did I say that trump or Clinton were any better just that Johnson was a fucking loser who should have dropped out after than groan inducing gap that just painted all us libertarians as clueless about foreign affairs. gt You're probably a troll but do you even realize how stupid you sound I want my candidates to have at least a working knowledge of global politics fuck me right gt Do you realize how many trillions we've spent bombing brown people under Trump while still probably being less than we would have spent on the same under Clinton Well since the entire military budget for any given year is somewhere around 650B Source cbo.gov We can do a little math and we come to something around 2 trillion dollars have been spent on all military operations including the VA and the F35 fighter and the bases in the South Pacific and Area 51 and NORAD and the new aircraft carrier all the other shit since trump took office in January 2017. In fact the total amount of military spending should be a little less than the stimulus bill that was just handed down from on high last week. To say that that might be less than Clinton would have spent is possibly true and possibly untrue. Aside from a few targeted attacks to get Iran to back the fuck off trump has been steadily backing down on overseas forces throughout his presidency. Lets be clear here the man is a fucking moron as well but I won t go so far as to say he s been a terrible president so far. Yes there are things I ve hated about his policy decisions and things I ve admired gt People laugh at Johnson and then just pretend we're not doing anything wrong in the middle east or any number of similar places. No I laugh at Johnson because we re doing things that are wrong in the Middle East and he was completely clueless about the worst of them. Seriously the man came off as a bumbling fool who wasn t qualified to run a hot dog stand more or less a country. I m somewhat astounded that he was ever elected governor.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Dr-No-,t2_4epb8zq,Reposting my Sowell critique I can't stand Sowell all style and no substance when it comes to him. amp x200B On Classical Economics planted the seed of doubt in my mind. Now classical economists are no liberals Democrats. But they differ from Sowell's monetarism and that's been a historical schism. When I read that book I could not get over how Sowell was absolutely smearing classical economists...straw manning their views bombing with questionable references using outdated research etc. I started reading his books with a more analytical eye and saw how he always does this. Most pernicious is his reference bombing...he ll have a paragraph with ten references half of which are junk and the other half supporting his most anodyne observations while leaving his most controversial statements un or poorly sourced. That gives him a giant bibliography and conveys a sense of authority. amp x200B Let me break down one of his statements amp x200B gt Despite the grand myth that black economic progress began or accelerated with the passage of the Civil Rights laws and War on Poverty programs of the 1960s the cold fact is that the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960. This was before any of those programs began. Over the next 20 years the poverty rate among blacks fell another 18 percentage points compared to the 40 point drop in the previous 20 years. This was the continuation of a previous economic trend at a slower rate of progress not the economic grand deliverance proclaimed by liberals and self serving black leaders. Ending the Jim Crow laws was a landmark achievement. But despite the great proliferation of black political and other leaders that resulted from the laws and policies of the 1960s nothing comparable happened economically. amp x200B Is this really the strongest form of his argument He looks at the absolute decline in poverty instead of the relative decline in order to prove a point. If instead he said poverty declined by 46 between 1940 1960 and 38 between 1960 and 1980 his argument would look weaker. Moreover in the 1960 80 comparison he starts off in a time of economic boom and ends in a recession. If instead he picked 1975 or 1985 you'd get a 49 decline in poverty. amp x200B Plus he does nothing at all to explain any differences in drops in poverty. He associates a perceived lower drop in poverty to Great Society programs with no proof. I could just as easily say that the reduction in poverty we saw between the 40s and 60s was just a combination of a postwar boom and the great migration of Blacks to the North and that thanks to the Great Society programs the reduction in poverty continued once those one time boosts were eliminated. amp x200B gt And there were serious retrogressions socially. Nearly a hundred years of the supposed legacy of slavery found most black children being raised in two parent families in 1960. But thirty years after the liberal welfare state found the great majority of black children being raised by a single parent. amp x200B His contentious claim is that the increase in single parent households is due to the rise in the liberal welfare state. But he gives no proof and doesn't really address that the percentage of white children born to single mothers more than sextupled with apparently no ill economic effects The Akerlof and Spooner studies give a much more plausible reason for the rise in single parent households cultural changes and cheaper contraceptive technology. After all fertility rates have plunged. The average married black woman had like 5 children in 1960 compared to two today. The average unmarried black woman had 4 kids in 1960 compared to just over 3 today. Cutural changes have led to higher divorce rates and for the first time you have single parent households headed by very affluent women. amp x200B gt The murder rate among blacks in 1960 was one half of what it became 20 years later after a legacy of liberals law enforcement policies. amp x200B That number for the murder rate sounds right and it was up for everyone during that period but where is his proof that it is due to law enforcement policies After all I am sure many libertarians would argue that the increase in the rate was due to the drug wars. Why doesn't he credit liberal inspired removal of lead in the water for the great reduction in crime we have seen since then amp x200B gt Public housing projects in the first half of the 20th century were clean safe places where people slept outside on hot summer nights when they were too poor to afford air conditioning. That was before admissions standards for public housing projects were lowered or abandoned in the euphoria of liberal non judgmental notions. amp x200B Again this is just Sowell standing on his soap box. He offers no proof and just makes these spurious correlations from anecdata. amp x200B gt And it was before the toxic message of victimhood was spread by liberals. We all know what hell holes public housing has become in our times. gt gt The same toxic message produced similar social results among lower income people in England despite an absence of a legacy of slavery there. If we are to go by evidence of social retrogression liberals have wreaked more havoc on blacks than the supposed legacy of slavery they talk about. Liberals should heed the title of Jason Riley s insightful new book Please Stop Helping Us. amp x200B More anecdata. No one pushes victimhood culture more than Sowell when's he's defending conservatives and Republicans as victims of liberals Democrats. amp x200B Let us take a passage from Wealth Poverty and Politics that had me nearly throwing the book against the wall. amp x200B gt It is clear that Black Americans have advanced significantly in the past couple of decades. Between 1960 and 1980 crime was down source education was up source household income was up source But you have seen stagnation since those years source source source Many have noticed these issues and offered solutions to them drumming up support in the process source source Conventional ideology is that we need more welfare programs source But that is ignoring the harmful effects of welfare programs on the Black family. The Black family unit has disintegrated since the 60s source Indeed welfare programs have even affected Whites in this matter source Welfare programs contribute to this Government workers would knock on our doors and inform women that they were eligible for welfare source This incentivized single motherhood. With no reason to stick around Black fathers left their homes and Black children were deprived of a father figure Living with a father figure is crucial to long term success source source Moreover welfare programs have incentivized laziness amongst Backs. The motivation to get an education or a job is removed. This is a major issue destroying Black culture where to be educated and well spoken is to be seen as White source describing the phenomenon but not the extent or impact of it Black children learn this lesson in school and conform to it amp x200B On the surface that looks like a well researched well referenced paragraph. But the most contentious points don't have the research behind it Sowell constantly pulls off that trick. I'm surprised more don't call him on it I guess at this point he plays to an audience that is on his side. amp x200B That too some of his sources are questionable. He won't use government or official stats for crime and education since 1980 but will use the numbers of some think tank. amp x200B Here is one article showing his hypocrisy on trickle down theory angrybearblog.com amp x200B On top of all that his predictive record is terrible He predicted that Obama's policies would bring doom and gloom that Bush's policies would bring prosperity. His understanding of the monetary system is incredibly flawed. His insistence that people act rationally enough to act as a basis for economic modeling is absurd.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,tapdancingintomordor,t2_ewrq0,gt It could just as easily be the case that government is taking its cues from the people. It's not that either. The Swedish government is taking its cues from the Swedish version of Dr. Fauci and he's been quite clear that it's not a long term solution to shut down the society while leaving the door open for more intrusive options if we the Swedish people doesn't take enough precautions. Which of course isn't a business as usual mentality either. This article spectator.co.uk is better.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ObnoxiouslyPolitical,t2_3o3zfoup,Some of us lack that privilege. For some of us this shit affects us in ways that would be thoroughly affected if Trump took a second term. Things that would be relatively less bad if it was literally anyone but Trump.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,baronmad,t2_e8mxg,As a swede this is not the case for me im not afraid of attracting the corona virus because i understand that we must actually work so that our economy doesnt collapse so there are things in the stores to buy. Why marry the danger of the corona virus together with a certain economic collapse that will hurt countless more people in the long run then the corona virus will do anyway. Its pretty much the same thing to sit down in a car and notice it doesnt have a seatbelt so you tie a noose around your neck and secure the rope to the seat in case you should crash. It doesnt help it just makes thing way way worse.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,goinupthegranby,t2_agn6n,Where I live BC which has public healthcare we receive daily TV livestreamed briefings from our provincial health officer who is an infectious diseases expert who just today announced that we have been successful in flattening the curve. Seeing posts in r libertarian claiming the US response is proof public healthcare doesn't work when that's not what the US has while it actually is working here is painfully ridiculous. More importantly though it's that here an infectious disease expert and other public health experts are running the show and the politicians are following their lead whereas in the US at the federal level they're in direct conflict with each other. Republican anti science and anti expert dogma is really the main problem. The Governor or Georgia just announced that he found out that asymptomatic carriers can pass it on and that its a game changer for them' Health officials have been saying this since January but Republicans ignore science.

I think you are vastly underestimating the ignorance of small minded people. I can say confidently that my neighbors have been completely mislead by internet drama as to the facts regarding viral transmission and prevalence of cases and they believe that they are not in danger because they don t live in NYC. They think it s BS that people are getting arrested for going out but are completely disoriented when it comes to things like airborne contagion or how long the virus can live outside a host or why soap is effective.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,LeastCreativeDrawer,t2_4bcpkkff,Anyone remember in 09 when the NJ police repealed their decree stating that they wouldn't detain people just because of their race Remember when an officer testified in 03 that there was a secret society in the New Jersey State Police that would demand rookies falsify records in order to test their loyalty to the badge When rookie officers wouldnt comply the Lord's of Discipline would physically assault the rookie officers and destroy their property. Luckily the court had the tax payers pay the officer 400k to fuck off and suspended members of the secret society from policing for a few weeks. Remember when Chris Christie had the SP use tax payer money to buy helicopters that he then used for personal travel to and from baseball games Remember when NJSP told Mrs Musarra on camera she had the right to remain silent whilst arresting her for remaining silent

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Madozz_,t2_cz2q6l9,Medicare for all is a way to pay healthcare services through taxes ensuring healthcare for everyone without private costs and that everyone pays for it in the correct way it's the closest thing American can have to Europe healthcare policy The incompetence is due to privately selected nurse doctors instead of state selected based on merit this has nothing to do with Medicare for all also I'd argue of doctors wouldn't be payed as much only the people who really care about their patients and their job would become doctors avoiding most of the incompetence If you mean the problem with overcrowding that's a problem mainly with how late US and also Italy in my case responded to the threat. We waited at least 2 weeks too long while America is still not all on lockdown so that's a government problem not a Medicare problem

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Shin47,t2_irfx6,Ok. Coming from a non libertarian and non American perspective I would say this doesn t make a lot of sense. The US government has deliberately set itself up to have very limited input in the running of healthcare so of course they re now doing a terrible job with the outbreak. The real test will be to compare the results after this whole thing blows over with other countries with Universal healthcare systems. If the US has more cases and deaths than anywhere else in the developed world clearly their capitalist healthcare has failed to an extent. If it does better clearly it has been better. I m very pro certain liberties in some areas such as legalising drugs and a host of other things etc. however I believe that the free market works very well in some areas and pretty poorly in others. This virus is the ultimate test of every nation s capabilities. The evidence will be plain to see when the dust settles.

This is a pretty stupid argument. Libertarian socialism is literally anti statist it doesn t want the state to end capitalism it often rejects the state itself and advocates for voluntary means of achieving its goals. What you re describing is not libertarian socialism. There are forms of left wing libertarianism that are pretty much identical to most right libertarians with the exception of land resources being private ie they believe no one can own land or natural resources as they belong to everyone similar to how you cannot own air. An example of a practical manifestation of this is geolibertarianism which advocates for a land tax under libertarian principles. gt I argue leftlibs are generally those trying to trick those with real jobs from becoming libright where liblefts become more libright when they actually start working or owning property or run their own business.

Essentially the difference between ruling A is overturned because it is unconstitutional and A is overturned because it is unconstitutional in the context of B means that another version of A not in the context of B can be passed and there wouldnt be precedent to immediately strike it down. The enforcable part of a courts opinion is whether subsequent attempts are stopped. So I think its fair to bring up the nuance.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jme365,t2_5h7yb3sd,CPAP machines do 90 of what ventilators do with the exception of being able to initiate breathing and measure oxygen levels.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,mtbizzle,t2_7bokw,Can someone briefly tell me why I'm wrong Health care in the U.S operating in a functioning free market is a fantasy. If it were provisioned by a free functioning market while also bearing the costs of healthcare in a developed nation the extent of lack of access would be inhumane. The market exacerbates the collective action problems that pervade healthcare to the detriment of everyone's interests except perhaps for a very small few Essay on why our system is a sack of shit and a technocratic governmental approach may be more suited to the problems of healthcare I think that for the vast majority of questions of resource allocation distribution benefits burdens a market that is careful to not allow externalized costs is the answer. Not so with healthcare. Collective action problems are a major reason why. There are SO many ways that healthcare could be better structured to reflect everyone's long term interests. The structures and incentives of our system are in many ways obscenely stupid. And we can see some of that in the regularly cited disconnect between the obscene costs of our system and relatively poor outcomes. Due in part to the extremely technical nature of the subject it's extreme importance to customers and related inelasticity of demand and the incentives involved in being a salesman a bare free market would I believe make things much worse. The entire model of medical care is built on trust that providers are always acting in patient's best interest. Financial self interest DOES play a role as it stands and the ways in which it plays a role are not pretty. I confidently believe they are not in patient's interests. Doctors would not want these factors in play in the provision of care to their family members and I do see them take steps to prevent it. As David Hume recognized government is a convention that exists to solve practical problems that arise from living in society with other people. Eg rules of property enforced by government are a convention to solve collective action problems surrounding property better for each individual to steal and defraud yet better for all as individuals if people do not steal and defraud. Healthcare fits the same model. It involves a bundle of collective action problems that are best addressed by experts considering the public as a whole. This is one of the few types of social problems government is uniquely fit to solve. No government approach would be perfect but as long as it maintained a strong technocratic bent which is easier than it sounds because of the undeniability of hard data the resulting system would better suit both the general interest and the vast majorities interests.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Nefnox,t2_tdzbd,Its an important distinction take it from someone who has lived and at one time worked in a number of healthcare systems including in the UK. redistributive healthcare systems that use government money to subsidise insurance policies in a means tested manner and act as insurer of last resort work very well e.g Belgium the Netherlands nationalised systems like in sweden or the UK work poorly and tend to result in fairly inegalitarian practices. There are many reasons and healthcare is immensely complicated and Belgium and the netherlands arent perfect but this is in a big way because in the prior the recipient of healthcare still has choice over which provider they choose for the most part but in the latter the only choice for 95 of the population is the government which means they have no incentive to improve their services because you cannot choose not to participate in them you cannot walk away.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Datrooph123,t2_4tl7ihq,Hmmm. Judging a healthcare system based on a once in a generation pandemic seems a little out there. You don t staff and resource permanently for something like this because it s not feasible. Look folks i know this generation or two have a had quite comfy lives with little risks. World History shows this is not the norm. We act like there is enough money and resources to handle any act of God but the truth is we have little control and we will never have all the resources. This is a facade. Unfortunately the virus is just the spark. It s not what you should be scared of. The aftermath is what people should start worrying about.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jme365,t2_5h7yb3sd,Many people and references claim that the 1833 case Barron v. Baltimore held that the BOR didn't apply to the States. However if you actually read that case it only deals with the 5th amendment and even then only in the context of property not the more common usage of the 5th. Since the Barron v. Baltimore holding was actually dicta obiter dictum with respect to the REST of the BOR that conclusion is obviously wrong.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,zanthraxnl,t2_39ucb,You know how incomes tax is bracketed Say to pay 25 over the first 50k. Then 35 over the next 50k to 100k and 40 over the rest. The idea of negative income tax is to have an additional bracket for low income. Say your first 15k is taxed at 10 this means you actually receive additional money or a tax benefit as an incentive for having a job and not being a welfare leach.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,joelfarris,t2_4w9wj,gt in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added And as extending the ground of public confidence in the Government will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jme365,t2_5h7yb3sd,Is anyone aware that the BOR was actually ratified in March 1939 Hint In 1939 somebody apparently realized that to ratify a Constitutional Amendment you aren't supposed to count state ratifications where that state wasn't a state when the Federal House and Senate voted 2 3s each to pass the Amendment. Three states that hadn't ratified the BOR in the 1789 1791 time frame mysteriously voted to ratify the BOR in March April 1939 150 years later. They had counted one state ratification in about 1791 that was from a state which hadn't voted to form that 2 3s vote in the Federal House and Senate. They discovered this ooops in 1939. Only one of those 1939 ratifications would have been necessary to fully ratify the BOR in 1939. Nevertheless three of them did.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,demingo398,t2_21erc3pi,If we want to talk pure economics lets do the math. COVID19 is highly infectious. The 80 number for infections with no controls is probably reasonable. The current death rate in the USA is 2. 5 327 million 80 2. 5 6. 54M. Now the government and insurance companies have calculated the economic value of a human life. This number sits around 9 million. 9M 6. 54M is 58. 8 Trillion. There you have it from a pure mathematical standpoint the shelter orders need to cause economic disruption over the next several years greater than 58. 8 trillion for it to be a negative financial move. For reference GDP is just under 20T a year. 6. 54M is a hard number to visualize. If you picked the lowest population states and had every person in them die to illustrate the point we'd lose Rhode Island North Dakota South Dakota Delaware Alaska Vermont and Wyoming. So yes the temporary hit to the economy sucks. Yes it puts a lot of people into a bind. Yes it's causing hardship. No it is no where near as bad as if we just let the virus run rampant. And this is just a dollars point of view not even approaching the social chaos that would ensure if infection death rates got any where near those numbers.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,G-I-T-M-E,t2_s0rab,So what s your current take on the situation Lack of respirators protection gear masks etc. everywhere. An aircraft carrier out pf service due to infections thousands dead the number of infected person doubling in 4 days. New York is shut down temp clinics in Central Park makeshift morgues in reefer trucks at hospitals. At least 10 million jobs lost in two weeks. And all signs show that this just the beginning even It s just a democratic hoax Trumps admits that 200 000 deaths are absolutely possible to be expected. Still a hype train

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,relditor,t2_ap0jp,The libertarian free market fantasy for health Care will fail miserably. Corps will quickly carve out monopolies and hold life saving treatments and pharmaceuticals hostage. They're already doing this under our current system. There's no greater motivator for patients than avoiding death and the demand it creates will drive the greedy to abandon all human decency. All other developed countries have seen this and their citizens have decided to band together under some sort of universal healthcare coverage.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jme365,t2_5h7yb3sd,gt Personally I view left libertarianism as anarchism. In anarchism there is no state and without a state private property cannot exist and therefore capitalism cannot exist. Nonsense. As long as guns for example exist private property can exist.

Every interaction someone has with another person is a multiplier effect on the chances you will get it. You're diabetic it doesn't look good for you if you do. Based on early data Diabetes and being Overweight are the two leading comorbidities responsible for COVID19 deaths. I can understand the economic concerns but the risk is real. The other posters here so say they only see people who are safe are the exact type of people who will get diabetics like yourself killed. This is not the flu this is not the common cold it is far worse. But don't take my word for it don't take Reddit's word for it. Start poking around Facebook start finding comments from front like medical professionals. Not fancy national doctors but people who work at local hospitals. Nurses Nursing assistants ER doctors. Read their stories their first hand accounts of how horrific the suffering can be of those infected. Then make up your mind.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DeveloperForHire,t2_wwubi,Authoritarianism is evil it's literally the opposite of libertarianism. No one should take away my rights. Socialism is politically apathetic. It's an economic stance rather than a political system. That's why it is possible to be libertarian and support socialism Libertarian Left You can have your guns your privacy your rights. Socialism doesn't take that from you. Authoritarianism does. Socialism's goal is shift the government's stance to allowing us to have not only the right to live but to live a life where we aren't afraid of losing everything due to an act of God. It is the authoritarian people in power regardless of economic stance who take away your rights. That in my eyes is truly evil.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Tekshow,t2_12wbo5,Hospitals shouldn t be a business Banning private hospitals That s the point of universal healthcare controlled costs. Privatizing a second option risks destabilizing the system. Much like how you don t have much choice for on which unregulated internet provider to use. They come in and cut costs and absorb competition. Now they charge whatever they want because maybe you have 2 choices if that in your neighborhood. Costs have gone way up internet went from being 20 a month to the cost of the cable bill itself averaging 60 plus. Secondly tell me who they re depriving Who s suffering because they re unable to open the private hospital of their dreams
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Hyta,t2_5vq2m,Wait are you saying that the US has the highest per capita healthcare spending in the entire world and a it's good because they earn the money and spend it on saving lives and their expenses trickle down to poorer countries in the form of medical research ect or b it's bad because it's expensive and wasteful
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,kwantsu-dudes,t2_c556r,Or you know dozens of other options. It's crazy how partisanship actually has effected our views on policy. Boiling down our actually choices of policy to the ones only mentioned by politicians. Here's one specific alternative. Insurance simply covers risk. Then we can debate about private or public offering such. If we want pre existing condition coverage that should be discussed as a separate subsidy not included in the same framework of insurance. Because insurance is for the unknown. The European systems are actual quite different. You can't just lump their frameworks all together. But one main similarity is price controls. The only reason why a single payer eliminating competition would be effective is if health care providers are required to offer their services at a specific price. Otherwise they'll simply deny their services and voters will be pissed and demand that government do anything possible to provide them access to the care that they promised to their citizens. And that means more costs for us. And what's not discussed much in the presentations of universal health care Price Controls. Because they aren't popular. Because they are very clearly a disincentive on supply. And when we already have a supply problem even before Covid 19 I'm not understanding why it's a popular solution. The current market sucks because health care providers and insurance providers collude to price individuals out of the marketplace and require a memebership to gain access to anything resembling a market based price. This is anti free market behavior. It's the type of govenrment regulations that most people includong conservatives and classical liberals would actually support. But politicians ignore it. I don't even know of any actually even discussing it. The further issue is that we are discussing our government. If our government is bought by big pharma and other corporations that only gets worse with a single payer system. Where you'll only be covered for certain branded medicafion only certain procedures involving certain medical equipment etc.. That's the other thing I don't hear discussed. What's actually covered If there are multiple ways to address an issue who gets to make that choice Will cost be factored in at all when the public has to foot the bill It doesn't clearly work. Because they don't exist in a vacuum. They aren't getting all their medical equipment personnell medication R amp D etc. from themselves or only from systems like their own. They are benefiting from the American system as it exists today. So if we change it will impact then as well. Why isn't this ever discussed either You're the one biased by not being able to understand that change doesn't automatically mean progress. And that there are millions of factors to consider. Even if we establish it will be less costly and thus presumably allowing for more access with a negative effect of supply that improved access might not come to forwishen. You can't apply a leash to tiger and believe it will behave the exact same as a leash on a dog. There are so many differences invloved in the based that applying the same thing doesn't simy present you with the same results. It's just so weak minded to conclude such.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,tomatoswoop,t2_8e08d,America is the only developed country in the world where getting a driver's licence is a pain and it's specifically because of American's fear of big central government. Pick any European country at and there's a high chance at random that the way you get a drivers license is to fill out your details online or on a paper form which you post and then receive your documents promptly in the mail. I just got a renewed drivers license a few weeks ago in my country. I it all did online and got it in the mail a few days later. Last year I needed a new passport quickly for an emergency. I booked into a fast track centre paid the fee turned up at my designated time spoke to the official a few minutes later and got a passport printed that same day... Half of the US government believes government is always the problem and is determined to prove it by running your government in an ass backwards way. There is literally no reason for the DMV to be such a piece of shit you could centralise everything and it would run completely painlessly like every other developed country but it doesn't happen because of a toxic political culture.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,BriefingScree,t2_147g3w,The ruling doesnt make the law conditionally valid. The courts struck it down period. So long as 1 person can fall through the cracks the law is unconstitutional by precedent. The law itself as it stood was struck. Your point is only relevant to the next case not to the fact the law was still struck
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Cyril94,t2_srek1pp,You object to the disparity in the compensation of the workers and of the ownership. Remove this disparity however you remove the motivation for the ownership to start the business in the first place. By demanding equality therefore you kill the Golden Goose and no one gets anything. This is how socialism replaces non uniform Prosperity with uniform misery as it has done numerous times. Socialists do not love the poor they hate the rich.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ILikeBumblebees,t2_3u3pr,gt The government is not generally for profit. All human activity is for profit in the broadest sense inasmuch as it's intended to fulfill the motivations of the people doing it. That means the behavior of institutions will be determined by the motivations of the people making the decisions in those institutions. The relevant question is whether the complex of incentives and structural constraints does a better job at restraining people acting on the worst motivations in commercial or political institutions respectively. And I think it's pretty clear that it's political institutions that pose the highest risk of people acting on malicious motivations and getting away with it. This seems to be supported by the fact that when people in commercial institutions want to act on malicious motivations they often seek to co opt political institutions to actually do their dirty work but the reverse is not often true.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,BriefingScree,t2_147g3w,I prefer unlimited representative with multiple parliaments with an executive council instead. You have 10 parliaments. Each has a differemt part of govt. For example 1 is military 1 is finance 1 is immigration etc. Every citizen can designate anyone to serve as their representative in each parliament. They can change this at any time but counts are only updated intermittently. This means in.theory each parliament has tens of thousands of members but will likely be consolidated. You must get a majority of all represented voters with a minimum percent quorum to pass. If the legislation must pass through multiple parliaments it must pass each one.

I mainly take issue when these systems intended to prop up the individual are used by large corporations to prevent innovation see Disney and copyright lol With the healthcare stuff I 100 agree that the government will probably botch m4a just like they've been botching the ACA. I at least know that there is at least someone in the governing with my best interest at heart. I can't really say the same for Eli Lilly or Aetna.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ILikeBumblebees,t2_3u3pr,The US government acts unconstitutionally quite often why is it hard to believe that the Canadian government is similarly inclined
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,tomatoswoop,t2_8e08d,visualcapitalist.com so technically false but very close to true. The US spends more public money than most countries per capita 5x the OECD average more than Sweden Canada the UK Germany... More than almost every country with universal healthcare... If you include private costs too the US spends more than double all the biggest healthcare spenders. Basically the US pays more taxpayer dollars for healthcare than European countries and then additionally spends that same amount again on private healthcare costs and still doesn't have healthcare coverage after all that money.

Also its not really a thing. Where are you getting this Do y'all just repeat it as a mantra until everyone believes it Surgeries and treatments are triaged. Elective treatments might have long waiting lists and you can go get them through private healthcare if needs be. Emergency or important treatments have very short waiting lists. Because thats just a sensible way to run healthcare. Only organ transplant have the issue where people die waiting as they do everywhere because its the organ and not the surgery that is in short supply.

So often the libertarian view on these issues is that it would be better to reduce the power of the governments. Not because it is believed that businesses and capitalism are grand and perfect but that it would make it easier for those who are aware of the problems to avoid them.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DemonB7R,t2_853oa,Uhh yes they would retard. If they hold the purse strings they dictate what gets paid for and how much. Providers hate Medicare and Medicaid as it is because of the absurd levels of bureaucratic compliance requirements the stupid length of time it takes to get paid and that said payment is usually less than the break even point for them. You think the government is going to RAISE its reimbursement rates for stuff when they have 330 million people to cover instead of just and estimated 44 million That's insanity. Not to mention because of the above you're going to find more providers saying fuck this I'm not accepting Medicare you pay me in cash or private insurance or I don't see you. This leads to all the providers that would accept it being overwhelmed by far more patients than they can handle leading to the months long waiting periods that socialized systems have despite having maybe a third of America's population btw And you'll see fewer people trying to make medicine their profession because of this.

They're a direct grant not a loan to pay back and importantly they're spent directly by the end consumer as a near equivalent to cash so there's no short circuiting of the price feedback mechanism comparable to college tuition or health care due to the external funding. It would be better for programs like food stamps to be operated by genuinely social organizations independently of the political state there's something really wrong with the idea that the same institution that wages war overseas is the one that should be tasked with helping the poor at home especially given the variety of other institutions and institutional forms that our dynamic and diverse society produces but all things being equal a solution more like food stamps would be vastly preferable to the status quo regardless of what institution implements it.

Concentration of power through capital in the hands of a few tinpot dictator business' people with delusions of grandeur is the antithesis of democracy and human rights. Capitalism is working as intended. It just sucks. The people who like capitalism most are the winners. The more well regulated a capitalist system is the more social safety nets the less people are abandoned on the side of the road but no matter how much you push it they're still an uncomfortable part of a capitalist society that is always lurking in the background scaring people into not bucking the system too hard for fear they'll slip and become one of the abandoned. People tend to like democracy. Shedding adoration of capitalism is part of keeping democracy from falling apart. Just as people take some control over society through the vote they have to take some control over society through collective ownership of the means for which society can live and sustain itself. Otherwise they are forever fighting just to hang onto basic human rights and to keep food on the table. We could call that socialism but that's a very loaded word. What it essentially is that I'm taking about is democracy but for more than just a vote. Authoritarian socialism in police state countries is such a mockery of the need for collective democratic ownership. Democracy has to be the end goal regardless of what label you put on the path there. Dictators have had their chance a million times over throughout human history and they've proven that only a tiny fraction can manage anything resembling benevolence for an extended period of time much less competence.

Police are arguably a public good. Public schools have a lot wrong with them but there are tons of viable alternatives including parents taking direct responsibility for their kids' education and homeschooling so it's fairly easy for those motivated to opt out of the government dominated system. Health care on the other hand is the epitome of a non public good it's characterized by highly individualized services being rendered in person to specific individuals independently of each other a service that requires a high degree of skill and a high investment of capital to provide high barriers to entry make small scale competition difficult to sustain and the high threshold of skill and knowledge makes DIY solutions extremely chancy and difficult and an extremely high stakes market where decisions are often literally matters of life and death and deeply intertwined with peoples deepest values. And what you're proposing is to put this market under the de facto control of a political monopoly operated by an inherently corrupt and pervasively dysfunctional institution and inserting levers of de facto power into what's literally the most intimate and personal aspect of most people's lives that will invariably be manipulated by the very same people who are already manifestly using people's dependence on lower stakes state run programs as a source of leverage to push through other agendas.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,MercuryInCanada,t2_zmc9t,Amen. None of us are free until we all are free. We are in this together and if one person ends up in debt slavery then it can happen to anyone. And tying you're health care to privately owned insurance companies and your jobs isn't freedom it's direct control over you. You can't find a new job because if you get sick you get fucked. You do get sick and a private business decides you don't get treatment you die. Ensuring that your health will be taken care of is freedom. No private entity controls your life and if you die. And with universal coverage no one can take it away from you without threatening to take it from everyone and as everyone in nations with universal coverage will tell you they aren't going to take it away. And on top of all that covid proves private doesn't work. Bed counts and supplies are distributed according to who can pay. There's no insensitive to stockpile to expand before pandemics hit and coordinating with different hospitals and suppliers becomes a mess preventing efficiency. Tests aren't created for wide spread use but instead who can afford it meaning wider spreading of disease. The American mess is directly because of private insurance not governing.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,HelloJoeyJoeJoe,t2_7u6jrq7,Since this is someone Trump admirers and one of his very few friends it'll be interesting to see if he picks up some of this rhetoric

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Chrisc46,t2_ycno6,It's the nature of capitalism to capitalize. If there's an incentive and an ability to use government authority to so it will. Considering government has a monopoly on legal force the inevitability is obvious. Government will be utilized for force as long as government has such authority. The benefits of capitalism far outweigh the disadvantages. So the solution is to eliminate the government authority that will be corrupted for its gain. When government exists exclusively and explicitly to protect the natural rights of individuals there's nothing worth corrupting.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,RedDeadBilly,t2_3hc3zoer,I am getting a bunch of push back on this. Let me see if I can adjust your paradigm a bit so you ll understand what I am saying. Freedom of speech is not your freedom. Freedom of speech is a Restriction on Government. This means the government cannot punish you for you expressing a thought. This is a Good Thing and a Positive for Society. The only exceptions are the fire in a crowded theater that some other bonehead wrongly mentioned and anyone calling for violence against anyone else. Now for an example. It is possible to have a country say to the north of the greatest country ever to have existed that currently allows you to say anything that comes into your head. If the government has the ability under it s constitution to pass a law outlawing certain speech you would not have freedom of speech. In conclusion freedom of speech is not Your Freedom it is a Limitation of a Government s Authority. Thank you please hold your applause until the Q and A are done.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,drinkonlyscotch,t2_39jaw,Sure and I don t know any libertarians who are opposed to helping people in need they just think the federal government tends to be really ineffective and inefficient at this task. Smaller decentralized organizations with boots on the ground in their specific localities help more waste less and don t require involuntary taxation to do it. All that said most of us are far more open to local government safety nets than federal ones not just for some of the reasons stated above but also because individual taxpayers have more direct influence over local politics. Each vote is more powerful politicians are more accessible and if you don t like it it s easier to move into a nearby district without giving up your job etc. If you d like a really good primer on many of these fundamental concepts I highly recommend Friedman s Lecture Series youtube.com list PLOv GldVeFiXd1exZU0QLYC6ynwkQwbvz It s old but more relevant than ever and even if his flavor of libertarianism isn t for you he is one of the most thoroughly entertaining and engaging lecturers you ll ever see on these topics.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,BriefingScree,t2_147g3w,The system is bloated and more expensive than it has to be. The system still forces professionals to provide services they are overqualified for. A system cheap enough people pay cash would have less bureaucracy. An actually free market system would be cheaper provide more service and just overall be superior while also not inflicting violence on people. If people want to voluntarily set up their own system that is great go get em but it shouldn't be force on anyone. I do not suggest we move to a bad system but a better system.

Credit union is built for their account members not absentee shareholders. In the case of a housing cooperative is controlled by the members that use the living space.

I guess my problem with your post is that it presupposes that the aid the government is giving out is just free money for nothing when in reality the government has literally forced many people's place of work to shut down. Will there be folks who con the system and end up making more than they ever made at the job they lost of course. But most any waiter or bartender was clearing well over 600 a week when you include their tips and they have now been ordered to not work. If your argument is that the government shouldn't have ordered everyone to stay home then I agree with you but now that they've done that it's the least they can do to keep folks financially solvent in the interim. And again sounds like you need to work a little smarter and find a better path forward for the dreams you are talking about. There's hustling and there's scrambling. Working 3 part time jobs for over 60 hours a week is scrambling.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,dumbwaeguk,t2_1779wl,This might be true but also a public insurance system also comes with a regulatory system to ensure specific services. The job of providing actual care is largely contracted out to third parties in that clinics can't survive in competition if they don't comply with the terms of public health insurance payments since most people aren't paying out of pocket. I live in a country with a nationalized insurance system and a lot of private clinics who all accept national insurance cards. We've been handling the pandemic extremely well. The US isn't anywhere close to handling this in part because of all the for profit health services run by assholes and in part because whatever semblance of a national health care system the nation has is run by assholes who would love to see the concept of socialization die so they can prove a point.

People are not actually consuming more TP just buying it so the spike in demand is short term and will result in less demand after. So there should be no increase in production by the time it's all settled. It's all too short term to make any supply side changes. You are also trying to rationalize fundamentally irrational behavior. You assume people won't still buy 50 packs of TP and just put it on the credit card. You saw the stories of people taking out loans buying in bulk and reselling right How high do prices have to be to prevent this There is no benefit here. No market corrections. It's all just a short term shit show. Which is why any sane people advocate short term quotas and this is what most countries do.

State run Certificate Of Need regulation is a big rabbit hole to start on. Once you get a grasp on that you'll find that similarly heavy handed control of the industry is done through many branches of government. All these smaller controls of different aspects by different governmental parties adds up to a whole lot of governmental control.

Medicare and Medicaid aren t in any way related to actual treatment. It s insurance. So regardless if you have a private insurance or these the treatment you get is dependent upon which hospital you go to which for most civilians will be a community hospital not afflicted with any government. 3.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,chalbersma,t2_3nnhx,Let's assume that an insurance company is willing to give you a 5 discount for 10k subscribers because the value of getting 10k subscribers allows you to sell your product at a lower margin per subscriber and still make reasonably good money. Does it follow that they then would be willing to give you a 5 discount for every additional 10k subscribers thereafter Absolutely not That would lead to a free product to anyone who can give you 100k subscribers There are some fixed costs and while you might be willing to give an additional discounts for more people you can't give as big of discounts as the first discount because the economics don't work out. Broadly this class of phenomenon is known as Diminishing Returns en.wikipedia.org And it shows up essentially everywhere in economics including in negotiations for insurance rates.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,You-said-it-man,t2_4rk091av,At least open your eyes to how your being used as pawns by a party that know exactly what they are doing with you. And aren't giving you an ounce of respect. See the reason you hear about some Bernie supporters saying they are voting Republican is because to them Republican is no difference than the democratic establishment. So to them they are not sacrificing their principles. However voting Republican sends them a message that they are not blind followers who can be manipulated into voting for a party that has zero respect for them out of fear they have nowhere else to go. I mean how many supporters of Bernie were sending small donations. And plenty of his supporters who donated probably didn't have tons of cash to spare but did anyway because they believed in a movement. And because of how they were used had their donations ultimately wasted. Now just because you donate to a campaign you believe in and your candidate loses doesn't make your money go to waste. However in this case it was because the democratic establishment knew exactly from the beginning who wasn't gonna be the nominee. So supporters that were passionate who would donate money because they believed in a cause had nothing more than an illusion of seeing their movement succeeding. They never had a chance. They literally got made a fool of because they actually thought they had a chance but the corrupt establishment always knew what they were doing with not allowing Bernie to get the nomination. This is the ultimate slap in the face. Sheer disrespect to those supporters that gave so much to this movement. So they are pissed. This along with seeing the Republicans as no different than the democratic establishment therefore not sacrificing their principles and values has them to the point where on principle they will send a harsh message because fuck them Now obviously a lot are not going to vote Republican. Some will vote libertarian or third party others won't have any motivation to get out a vote at all and some of course will vote Democrat regardless. But these are the reasons some will vote Republican libertarian 3rd party or just not vote at all.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Chrisc46,t2_ycno6,I think there is a solution that opens the markets reduces costs but does not let the poor go without access to care. There are a few categories of things that need to be addressed. The first thing is to make sure those needing assistance are not cut off from care while allowing the market to grow to cover them over time. These are the steps that need to be taken for this. 1. Medicaid needs to continue to exist with rules in place to tighten requirements over time. This is to guarantee healthcare for the poorest Americans. 2. Current insurance plans need to be grandfathered for an extended time as well. Insurance companies cannot drop those covered under already negotiated plans and they cannot force changes to the plans. The second thing is to encourage the growth of competition and supply of care. These things must be done to accomplish this. 1. Repeal all frivolous regulations put in place by the ACA that simply add to the cost of opening new or expanding existing clinics and hospitals. 2. Streamline and reduce licensing and educational requirements to encourage more people to enter the healthcare field. 3. A systematic reduction of FDA regulations needs to happen in order to ease the prohibitive cost of developing new medications. This includes pushing for quicker and easier OTC approval for drugs. 4. Patent and other protections need to be reduced to encourage quicker advancement of meds and equipment and speed the approval of generic drugs. 5. Require all health providers to have listed prices for the care they provide. This would add transparency for the customer and force providers to directly compete for customers through price and quality improvements. 6. Decrease the taxes that are associated with all of the above thus decreasing the costs further. The third is to change the way that insurance is used. It should never have become a payment plan for all healthcare and should become insurance again. This can happen through some changes. 1. Allow insurance companies to offer cheap low risk plans that cover catastrophic unexpected health needs. These plans should be designed with total cost coverage. For instance Plan A covers all health costs related to any accident illness that totals more than 500 including all future costs associated with it. 2. Insurance should no longer be required or expected to cover the cost of routine preventative care. However they should be encouraged to offer discounts for those that obtain that care such as annual check ups routine immunizations gym memberships etc. This will have the added affect of increasing demand for preventative care allowing for more opportunity to grow a competitive market for that care. 3. Keep a mandate for insurance but only for those catastrophic type plans. This will keep the market flush with low risk customers to maintain funding to cover those high risk expensive customers. If these things are done we should see prices reduce substantially for healthcare by eliminating the expensive administration costs associated with most care increasing competitive pricing decreasing other expenses associated with insurance and taxes. We'll see an increase in healthcare providers and insurers that are all competing for business by improving quality and decreasing costs. Prices for medications will also become much cheaper in a competitive market as more suppliers enter the market.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,jubbergun,t2_6j2la,The VA didn't have to be sabotaged. It's just like any other government endeavor. It's mostly staffed with mediocre people who are only there because it's cushy job with lots of benefits who are more concerned about covering their own ass than they are about accomplishing anything of value. The few people who are concerned with taking care of veterans are either swamped under the weight of the work that gets passed on to them because their slacker colleagues won't do it or spend more time fighting red tape than helping people until they eventually become demoralized. Then they either quit or become just another useless cog in the machine. My brother developed some sort of neuromuscular disorder and couldn't work any longer. He went to the VA after his regular insurance ran out. He's been going to the VA for treatment and his condition still isn't diagnosed. Several doctors have suggested he has a specific disorder but refuse to sign their name to a diagnosis. He had been contacted by a group that attempts to diagnose rare disorders for research and study. They would probably need able to help. Unfortunately they require a referral letter written by a doctor currently involved with his treatment before they can accept him. He's been trying to get a referral letter for four months. None of his VA doctors want to write it likely because if he goes to someone competent and actually concerned about doing their fucking job he'll get a quick diagnosis which makes the VA and his doctors look bad and if you're covering your ass you don't want look bad.

You just have a fetish for the government stealing money and inefficiently redistribute it to people that it deems in deed while never fixing the real problem.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,StickyRobot,t2_lmtg4,It does actually. Both en.wikipedia.org nations have a higher life expectancy than those in the US. Both en.wikipedia.org nations pay MUCH less per person on healthcare. Unless you're talking about the Corona virus in which case both nations were hit by it MUCH earlier than the US. In either cases the US has more cases currently than both nations combined orldometers.info and is on track to exceed both in total deaths after a few more weeks.

Have a great day.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,stmfreak,t2_35y7h,Sure we regulated a free market system into monopolistic pricing. One solution would be more regulation which is what single payer offers without explaining how it might lower prices. Another solution could be less regulation allowing competition. Which we know lower prices. The first is economically unfeasible and will collapse under its own costs. The second is politically unfeasible and will never happen before single payer is tried and fails. Shouldn t be hard to predict what s coming next.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,dangshnizzle,t2_d35c7,Wait... you think public schools have more money to throw around than private schools no

I'm not gonna start crying and screaming at every person who walks past me with a dog because I understand that the dog who attacked me as a child was a bad dog and that bad dogs are put down.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Boronthemoron,t2_lmon3,I like the idea of everyone having access to healthcare but I don't like that a lot of the proposals remove price signals as well as competition in the marketplace. My recent idea for healthcare is that for most procedures not including emergencies maybe we could ditch the entire insurance system and just have the government pay people the median cost of that procedure for that state. The doctors can set their price but people would shop around for the best doctor for the best price for the best timeframe that suits them. This would introduce price signal and competition into the system and drive down costs which would result in lower median price for each treatment overtime For emergencies the patient would just get taken to the closest Hospital and the Doctor would simply get the median price of the procedure for that state.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,DrunkBilbo,t2_3c8yhwmn,Voting power isn t something you re entitled to as part of your employment agreement. You don t get to reorganize society to suit your desires. The company and the investment group negotiates because it s advantageous for both parties. Voting defrauds the employer of any say in the matter. That s not freedom at all and it s not individual sovereignty. This is why socialist systems always end up back water shitholes. People don t actually rationalize the full extent of the system. An employee doesn t get to vote because their employment is at will. The employer negotiates the contract to entice people to work there. If they so chose to have an open system they can willingly form a co op that will inevitably be doomed to mediocrity and will never scale to any reasonable size and they re perfectly free to do so in the current marketplace.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,pervyfun77,t2_sqlad,The employer is able to join a bargaining group and bring costs waaaay down. The same insurance. They group up and get a discount that a single person would not be able to get on their own. They do pay a portion on your behalf most of the time but the whole cost is cheaper than if you would be doing it on your own. Especially if you work for a large organization.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,RedDeadBilly,t2_3hc3zoer,Under their constitution of course. They have different restrictions on the power of government than the US does. No freedom of speech over there.

Whether you want to go to universal health care or to some other system the fact that Americans are happy for insurance companies to be in charge of their access to health care is mind blowing to me.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,salsa_rodeo,t2_c5dlj,Yeah but at least people in Europe won t be left with crippling hospital bills to pay. It s amazing that people would rather leave our system the way it is than allow everyone free medical care.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,questiontime27,t2_3zchooxd,I am actually someone who deals extensively with China manufacturing and the truth of the matter is that China is already almost back to full capacity. There s some supply delays and the Wuhan area is off limits but everywhere else is back online and at least at 70 production. As much as you guys don t want to hear it China is the best place to mass produce. They have the expertise the work force and the entire supply chain. Sure you could go to Vietnam or Malaysia but it s just not the same. It will take years and years to develop their infrastructure while keeping costs low to keep it competitive with China.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ColinHalter,t2_jaauf,Yeah but how many of these big pharma companies are actually going to employ these policies Companies can be as transparent as they want sure but when your entire business model is based off of overcharging for necessities and charging ridiculous 7000 markups you're not going to be very willing to share those numbers.

You could have five more PhDs in your field and related ones but this is of public policy and government structure not the actual chemistry of drug development itself. gt They are developing antivirals vaccines and immunosuppressants to fight the cytokine storm that you refer to as a complication I don't know a better way for a private entity to step up In no way would this not happen with M4A. Private companies would continue to exist. M4A is the expansion of public healthcare services to everyone. Someone has to make the equipment and the drugs but the difference is that with a stronger government stepping up the drugs would cost less. That's one facet but you can tie it to almost anything.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,goinupthegranby,t2_agn6n,Americans pay more tax dollars for healthcare than any other country but unlike other countries most Americans don't even get coverage with that taxation they have to pay again into the private sector for coverage. And then again if they have to use it.

There are already 330 million people here and they're already all receiving healthcare. The delivery system and the thousands of bureaucracies involved are complete chaos but at the end of the day if you get in a car accident and you rupture your spleen someone is going to drive you to a hospital and patch you up regardless of your ability to personally pay for it. If you can't they'll send you a bill which you won't pay you'll declare bankruptcy or not and the hospital...continues operating and delivering healthcare to everyone else. All the healthcare is getting delivered all the bills are getting paid by someone or another and if they aren't the pricing on everyone else's has already baked in the free ride for the very poor. If everyone was really that interested in making healthcare free at the point of delivery they'd all just start refusing to pay their premiums their deductibles and their copays.

I'm not talking about quality of care or technological innovation I'm talking about the choice of the consumer which is the basis of a well functioning free market. gt As to the point about bargaining power what do you think is the difference between a corporate bargain and a union when negotiating a contract with a health system Those systems give voting power to the individual giving them a voice in the selection of their health plan. Individual non vested employees often have zero input into the choice of the company healthcare plan.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,datacubist,t2_im4hc,What data tells you the majority of the tax burden falls outside the top earners I bet you can t find a single source with numbers to back that up. And just because you believe a thing doesn t make it so. We can fight for something we believe is best for ourselves and the country
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,zucker42,t2_15f4m5,Altogether these are some quite interesting points and I'll have to look at your simulation results at some point. A few things 1. Unless I'm reading it wrong in Quinn's simulations Schulze Ranked Pairs only outperform STAR assuming assuming honest voting. 2. When I said utility rating I meant it closer to the economic usage of the term that is an unbounded value representing the net satisfaction you receive from a particular candidate. I think the article linked is flawed in that it equates utility to the honest 0 10 score in score voting. Still I don't believe the strategy I presented is provable optimal just reasonably strong and easy enough for the average voter to arrive at. That said I place a lot of value on the fact that approval is easy to explain and implement. I think it's impossible at this point to implement Schulze RPs in a way that would be possible to audit especially on the national or state level. Approval is not perfect nor the best in a theoretical sense but I think it's practical advantages outweigh it's theoretical disadvantages. Thanks for the information and arguments though.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,CrimsonHawg,t2_3c6m6y5v,Okay I ll try and explain this. I don t believe that objects or institutions have intrinsic value independent of demand. For example right now I would not want to buy a flower therefore I have zero demand for flowers which means to me they aren t worth anything. But let s say tomorrow I decide I need flowers because it s my wife s birthday. I might b willing to allocate a shitload of my resources to those now because I have a need for flowers. This is the case with the markets and the people that operate in them. People go to market and redirect resources to goods and services when the demand for those goods and services rises.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,GppDNAppA,t2_ucvca,Thanks for the education on viruses. I have a PhD in biochemistry and analyze drug development for a living. There are as I said more than 20 private companies stepping up to this all encompassing topic. They are developing antivirals vaccines and immunosuppressants to fight the cytokine storm that you refer to as a complication I don't know a better way for a private entity to step up
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,ColinHalter,t2_jaauf,I'd rather it be owned by the government than by medical industry themselves. At least the government is forced to be somewhat more transparent than private companies.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,RipsNips,t2_5brdkwl6,This is equivalent to me asking if the war on drugs is a waste of money then why does the U.S spend so much money on it How things are isn't indicative of how things should be. Unborn babies aren't recognized as such under the law they're treated like tumors amp their extermination is treated as a medical procedure. I'm not denying it that's how our society sees them. I'm arguing that this isn't correct. Similar to how a libertarian would argue that the current overreach of government in the U.S isn't right. You see how that works If the government shouldn't provide social welfare then why does the government provide social welfare Lol got you good.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,chalbersma,t2_3nnhx,Yes and it's a big part of why the Medicare expansion part of Obamacare didn't work. Instead if you allow private groups to band together to negotiate the price if healthcare as a group imagine r healthcare coop and make employer contribution to healthcare transferable and transparent suddenly you have competitive health insurance options that have the same economy of scale benefits as single payer solutions without the risk of catastrophic failure.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Darth-Hubris,t2_1ibmqtrq,Fair. Capping salary isn t a great idea. Let s leave it out. Great You just improved M4A. I also don t expect a doctor to work more in the M4A system so capping patients is fine. This is already done in our system. You have to call for appointments and wait periods can range from days to weeks. It s all about costs to the middle and lower class and we are seeing how devastating not having affordable health care or universal access is to the populace during the current pandemic we are facing.
Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Empty_Sandwich,t2_557gkdb7,The fact that the US the only country on the planet without single payer is the one country failing the hardest at treating people and has by far the highest infection rate should tell you something.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,pillbinge,t2_htiik,That's not how viruses work. Viruses are both living in some ways and nonliving. Cures are typically for bacterial infections. Viruses don't work that way. You can be inoculated but that's possibly it. It's a complicated topic. A treatment varies but treatment in most cases is staying home. Treatment in severe cases is going to the hospital where they can get ventilators to get assistance breathing or having some surgeries to help depending on complications. No one dies of a virus or anything really they die of complications. The original topic is about M4A or some variant. It's in the title. This topic is all encompassing and right now there are no private entities stepping up. You have businesses donating millions here and there against something that's costing billions if not trillions. Otherwise it tends to be people making due with what they have and working that anarchist lifestyle more than the libertarian one though there's only so much success with either

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,CedTruz,t2_jaxwz,Medicare works like this the government decides what it s going to pay a hospital for a procedure and then forces the hospital to accept it. The hospital then has no choice but to make up the difference by charging higher prices to non Medicare patients forcing insurance rates to artificially increase. There are two options no Medicare and everyone pays a lower rate or Medicare for all and everyone gets it for free but the hospitals close causing a massive gap in the amount of available medical coverage and lower quality medical care.

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,BriefingScree,t2_147g3w,It is called Median Voter Theory. People want one of the two extremes. Almost no one wants the middle ground. However being sllightly less bad than your opponent gets you votes. So candidates jockey the median and hope they land on the more favourable side even if no one wants that median posistion since ultimately only that median voter matters as that gets you 50 1

Libertarian,t5_2qh63,Chrisc46,t2_ycno6,gt You take what your job offers. You might but that's your decision. Many other people negotiate their salary or refuse job offers based on poor offers. gt taking a different job so you don t die of a lack of medical care The fact that government mandated a wage freeze that prompted employers to begin using healthcare as a benefit to circumvent the mandate should be considered a disgrace. gt Choice isn t the issue because there s no profit motive. I'm assuming that you understand that the profit motive is what drives business to compete against others for customer support through quality service and price. Without the profit motive none of that is incentivized. Monopolies and monopsonies have the counter effect. They are not beholden to the customer therefore they have little incentive to remain efficient and offer quality service. gt This statistic doesn t take into account overhead costs at all. Government has overhead costs too. It's especially true once you realize that most of the government operational functions for healthcare will likely be outsourced to for profit contractors. gt Not really. How so It's pretty widely known that reimbursement rates are quite low for government plans. It's so bad that many providers won't even accept patients from those programs.
